            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT would be hard to find out Reaſons which might juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the boldneſs of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication; did not the Subject of the Book direct it to Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes feet. Whither can Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Truth fly for refuge from foul Superſtition back'd with hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Fury, but to the Protection of that fortunate Arm to which
<pb facs="tcp:49990:3"/>already ſo many Nations owe the enjoyment of their Religion, their Liberty, and whatſoever is dear to Men and Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>By Your Heroick Courage, and more than human Conduct it is, that Our Selves are not the Subject of a like lamentable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and that we read the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Barbarities of theſe Bigots in a <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> Few Years, it was hop'd, would have paſs'd, before our own Country might have been the Scene of their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies; and what we now upon reading can hardly believe, we ſhould then have ſeen and felt. But the God of Heaven of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy check'd their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, forbad the proud Waves,
<pb facs="tcp:49990:3"/>and ſet bounds to their Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore, Mighty PRINCE, this humble Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt and fitteſt Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be made to Your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Name by us the Fellow-Sharers in that great Deliverance which Providence, by your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes means, has wrought for us.</p>

            <head>THE Tranſlator's Epiſtle TO THE READER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. 'TIS ſufficiently known by thoſe who have read the Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> that Liberty for the exerciſe of the Reformed Religion was eſtabliſhed by Law:<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> Hiſt <hi>p.</hi> 842.</note> The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> which allowed them that Liberty, was ſigned by <hi>Henry IV.</hi> in <hi>April 1598.</hi> which Edict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Narration of the former Edicts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, and of the Troubles occaſion'd in <hi>France</hi> about matters of Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis true the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> were ſomething unwilling to confirm this Edict, and ſome others made great oppoſition to it. The Biſhop of <hi>Modena,</hi> who was Pope<hi>'s</hi> Nuncio in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Berthier,</hi> one of the Agents for
<pb facs="tcp:49990:5"/>the Clergy, made many Petitions to the King, and did greatly importune the Lords of the Council very ſeriouſly and deeply to conſider the matter.<note place="margin">Ibid. 843, 844.</note> After the King had heard what was to be ſaid on both ſides, he was ſatisfied of the Wiſdom and Juſtice of what he had done, as well as of the Neceſſity thereof for the eſtabliſhment of the Peace of <hi>France,</hi> which had been almoſt ruined by the Wars that had been made by reaſon of Religion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King addreſſes himſelf by a Speech to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and told them, that he deſired and expected they ſhould eſtabliſh the Edict that he had granted to them of the Reformed Religion; and in brief tells them, I have made it, and will have it obſerved, and his Will ſhould ſerve for Reaſon, which is never demanded of a Prince in ſuch an obedient ſtate. After this Diſcourſe they confirmed the <hi>Edict</hi> in <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This <hi>Edict</hi> the Reformed accounted their great Security for the free exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and it really was ſo in great degree for many years.<note place="margin">See alſo a new Syſteme of the Apocalypſe, p. 219, 220.</note> How many Violations were offered thereunto in the Reign of <hi>Lewis XIII.</hi> I ſhall not enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:49990:5"/>in this place. Thoſe that have been offered thereunto by the preſent <hi>French</hi> Monarch before its utter Repeal, may be read in a little Book written ſome ſeven or eight Years ſince, called the <hi>Policy of the Clergy of</hi> France <hi>to deſtroy the Proteſtants of that Kingdom;</hi> to which you may add a ſecond, called, <hi>The laſt Efforts of Afflicted Innocence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And the truth is, their Practice is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Doctrine; they do affirm, that no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks, and that all Promiſes made to them are void of all Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; as in the famous Inſtances of <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague:</hi> more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Perfidiouſneſs might eaſily be produced,<note place="margin">Vid.

But after ſo

            <p n="7">7. I wonder with what front theſe Men can impoſe ſuch notorious Falſehoods upon the World: <hi>France</hi> entertains Ambaſſadors from all the Courts in Chriſtendom,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Jurieu</hi> ibid.</note> and is full of forein Travellers and Merchants, they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
<pb facs="tcp:49990:6"/>the Miſeries, Calamities, the Groans and Cries of the Reformed. We our ſelves have ſeen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them forſaking their Houſes, Lands, Friends and Eſtates, and coming over to us to find Bread in a ſtrange Land: and it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet known that Men ſhould forſake Plenty at home, upon the hopes of finding Cloaths to cover their nakedneſs, and Bread to keep them from ſtarving in a forein Country. Thoſe that can believe, theſe Men are not perſecuted, muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe their Senſes in more things than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The perſecuted <hi>French</hi> themſelves do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that their great Monarch is not bloody; they impute all theſe Severities that have been exerciſed upon them, to the Sollicitations of thoſe who have the conduct of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.<note place="margin">See a new Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme on the Apocalypſe, p. 224, 225.</note> They are the Prieſts and Clergy which have raiſed this Holy War againſt the Reformed: 'tis they that have blown the fire, and ſounded the Alarm to this Perſecution; and 'twere a wonder that there ſhould be a Perſecution, and ſuperſtitious Prieſts and Clergy have no hand therein. One of the ſharpeſt Perſecutions that was ever raiſed againſt the Primitive Chriſtians, was promoted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb facs="tcp:49990:7"/>by the <hi>Pagan Prieſts,</hi> as <hi>Sozomen,</hi> (I think) relates. The beſt things corrupted are the worſt: profane Prieſts and Clergy-men without Conſcience perpetrate and encourage the greateſt Villanies in the World.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Though this Perſecution be moſtly, if not wholly, owing to the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> yet I do not think them all equally guilty therein. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold,</hi> in his Preface to the Defence of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> of the Faith of the Church, againſt Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſpeaks more humanely concerning thoſe of the Reformed Religion in <hi>France,</hi>

And I am willing to hope, that there may be others of the ſame ſpirit and temper of this learned Man.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But Mens Sentiments alter, and what is ſound Doctrine at one time is hardly ſo at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſame learned Man, ſince the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb facs="tcp:49990:7"/>grew high in <hi>France,</hi> hath written ſundry piqued Books with bitterneſs and gall enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reformed, and thereby hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently countenanced and encouraged their Enemies againſt them. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> late of <hi>Condum,</hi> is a gentile Man, a florid Orator, and uſually ſmooth in his Diſcourſes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;<note place="margin">Vid.

               <hi>the moſt upright is ſharper than a thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. I ſpeak not theſe things with deſire to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate the Government againſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> Let us but be ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we may enjoy our own Religion in Peace, and I am content that they have the private Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their own. If they will hear what the Learned Men of our Church have to ſay for the Doctrine of the Reformation, and againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:49990:8"/>Doctrines which are properly and peculiarly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and can be argued out of the one into a belief of the other, I ſhould very much rejoyce therein.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Thoſe Doctrines which are peculiar to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are evidently Novel, and by degrees introduced upon primitive and ſimple Chriſtianity. This hath been irrefragably proved by the Divines of our own Church againſt the late Pamphlets and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Catholic Tradition, by D. <hi>Stilling fleet.</hi>
               </note> as well as by the Famous and Learned Monſieur <hi>Jurieu</hi> in his Paſtoral Letters. Chriſtianity is invariable; what it was in the days of the Apoſtles and Primitive Churches, it is at this day: all Additions that have been made thereunto are either needleſs or falſe; and ſuch are all the Novelties of the <hi>ROMAN</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But if thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be argued out of their Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Proſelytes to the Proteſtant Doctrine and Diſcipline, they muſt remain where they are. The Churches of the Reformation have not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their great Maſter to Dragoon Men into
<pb facs="tcp:49990:8"/>their Communion, and it ſeems to them to be utterly contrary to the Gentleneſs, Softneſs, and Kindneſs of Chriſtianity. It accords well enough with Mahometaniſm and the Alcoran to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte Men by drawn Swords and Piſtols, for there is but little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<note place="margin">See Memoirs of <hi>P. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> vol. 1. pag. 25, 26.</note> Reaſon, or Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can be produced to perſuade a Faith therein: and where Men cannot be converted by Arguments, they muſt make uſe of Clubs if they will gain any Proſelytes. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is furniſhed with ſo many of the one, that it has no need of the other.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Whatever Provocations thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may have given to the Church of <hi>England</hi> to treat them with Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Rigor, I would by no means that they ſhould uſe them. They are Men, and partake with us in the ſame common Nature, and I would not have them treated like Beaſts. If care be taken that they do us no hurt, I ſhould never deſire that any Violence be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them; let them ſit under their Vines and their Fig-trees, and let no man make them afra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

15. I ſhould be ſorry that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould repay the meaſure to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> that the Reformed have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in <hi>France.</hi> The great Author of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has learn'd us other Doctrine, and I hope we ſhall never depart from the Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof. He hath taught us to <hi>do good for evil, to pray for them that curſe us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.44.</note> and <hi>bleſs them that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and deſpitefully uſe us. We are willing to live peaceably with all men as much as in us lies,</hi>

               <hi>we will not avenge our ſelves, we will leave that to God, to whom Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance belongs. If they hunger we will feed them, if they thirſt we will give them drink, and by doing thus heap coals of fire upon their heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. I am as jealous and ſuſpicious of the Gentlemen of the <hi>Roman Perſuaſion</hi> as any Man, and hope that all care will be taken that it ſhall not be in their power to do us hurt; and when that is ſecure, I wiſh they may be treated with all the kindneſs that Chriſtianity requires of us. I am ſure the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:49990:9"/>is moſt full of Love, Sweetneſs, and Obligations; and there is nothing in the World that commends it more to the Acceptation of Men: and none do it more Honor, and more advance its Reputation, than thoſe that delight in Kindneſs, and ſcatter their Obligations upon all ſorts of Men: herein they do like the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.45.</note> who <hi>cauſes his Sun to riſe upon the good and the bad, and his rain to deſcend upon the juſt and unjuſt.</hi> 'Tis a thing of no great difficulty, to treat thoſe with Kindneſs that oblige us; but to ſhew Love to our Enemies, and an Affection for thoſe that hate and deſtroy us, is a more difficult Leſſon, and worthy of the Chriſtian Religion, which teaches Men thoſe heights of Perfection which cannot be learn'd any where elſe.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The Author of theſe following Letters is a Perſon far above all the Eulogies that I can poſſibly give him. His Writings have been of very great uſe to the Reformed in <hi>France;</hi> his Praiſe is in all the Reformed Churches in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, and he will be mentioned with honor to many Generations. The Subject-matter of
<pb facs="tcp:49990:10"/>his Letters is partly Doctrinal, and partly Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical. In the doctrinal part of them, he very well lays open the weakneſs and ſophiſtry of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, in the defences they make for their Falſhoods and Superſtitions. In the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part of them, he reports ſuch inhumane and beaſtly Cruelties exerciſed upon thoſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, as may cauſe a juſt horror to all that read it. He that can believe ſuch Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties do receive any countenance or encouragement from the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, may believe what he pleaſes. He may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Sun is the cauſe of Darkneſs, and that all the Fruits of the Earth are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Froſts and Snows of the coldeſt and moſt Northern Climates.</p>
            <p n="18">18. When the Learned <hi>Arabian</hi> obſerved that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Chriſtians ate their God, he ſaid, Let my Soul be among the <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> When I obſerve what Cruelties and Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are committed by them, upon their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, their Neighbours, and their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I do not ſay, Let my Soul be among the Philoſophers, but with old <hi>Jacob,</hi> I will ſay, <hi>O my Soul, come not thou into their

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu may be aſſured, that we are pierced and wounded with your Sorrows and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and that from the Haven where the Providence of God hath placed us, we do behold with eyes bathed in tears, the terrible Waves of that Tempeſt that toſſes you, and hath ſhipwrecked the Veſſels in which you are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued: We adviſe with our own hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with our duty, with the uneaſie ſtate and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which both you and we are, what we may do for your conſolation and ſecurity againſt the peril of ſeduction, and we can find almoſt nothing poſſible; inſomuch that till God ſhall open thoſe Doors that are at this day cloſed, we ſhall chuſe to ſpeak to you at a diſtance, in hopes that God will not tarry long ere he give us the opportunity of a nearer and more intimate converſation. We will obviate and oppoſe that evil that preſſes moſt hard upon you. We do not think the Croſs of Chriſt,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49990:12"/>which you now bear, is the greateſt calamity to which you are expoſed. 'Tis your Glory: and we find by Letters that come from thoſe that perſevere, that God is their Comforter, that he hath prevented our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he hath given efficacy to a few words, that we have ſent from far, that he hath abſolutely, and without us, wrought upon you, that he hath very much ſurpaſſed our hopes, that he is in you a living Fountain of Conſolations, more abundant than we could dare to hope. There do come Letters from our Confeſſors which are in Chains, in the Galleys, in Holes, and Dungeons of an hundred feet in depth, in dark Priſons, in Torments, which raviſh us, which revive the ancient times, which give a new birth to our ancient Martyrs, which make us know, that the greater the Torments are to which you are expoſed, the greater is the courage and ſtrength that God doth communicate for the bearing and overcoming of them.</p>
            <p>That which we moſt fear on your behalf, is Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, the Examples that we have ſeen with our eyes make us tremble. Perſons that we looked upon as Pillars, have been broken as Reeds. That which they call Conferences (that is to ſay, the Sophiſtry of falſe Teachers, who employ all their art to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) have perverted the Judgments of many, from whom we expected an invincible ſtedfaſtneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. They oppreſs and confound you with Diſputes. They put into your hands Books, in which Falſhood is clothed in the dreſs, habit and appearance of Truth. They take from you all thoſe things that may protect, and ſecure you from the Poiſon of thoſe venomous Serpents that are perpetually hiſſing in your ears. Whilſt our Hands are bound, and our Tongues tyed, we do with grief behold the Sheep of Chriſt rent and torn from his Fold, to be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dark Priſons of the Prince of Lyes. What is to be done in this caſe? It ſeems to no purpoſe to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49990:12"/>write more Books, there are a thouſand, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ready written, and very lately one was publiſhed, as an Anſwer to the malignant Subtilties of theſe falſe Teachers. But it will not come to you, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great care that is taken to prevent honeſt Men from going out of the Kingdom, and good Books from entering into it. If new Books ſhould be written, they would have the ſame fortune. Beſides, 'tis uneaſie to trouble the world with Repetitions, when we cannot have the hopes or conſolation of being profitable unto you thereby. If Repetitions muſt be made, it ought to be with ſome hopes of advantage. For this reaſon we are reſolved to write no more Books, but ſhall content our ſelves with Letters. It may be, that God may cauſe them to flie over all thoſe Ramparts that the new Inquiſition hath raiſed at all the Ports of the Realm. At leaſt there is ſome reaſon to hope, that they will more eaſily get over thoſe Obſtacles and Impediments, which are oppoſed to the deſign that we have to fortifie you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Temptation.</p>
            <p>We ſhall publiſh theſe Letters every month, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fifteen days, or more frequently, according to occurrences and neceſſities: and in them we ſhall endeavour to diſcover the illuſions by which we are aſſured that the Seducers will attempt to deceive you. Among others they make uſe of the Diſcourſes and Writings of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> of <hi>Petiſſon</hi> the great Converter, and Monſieur <hi>Nicholas.</hi> They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige you perpetually to read over the Expoſition of the Catholick Faith, written by that Biſhop, to paint, and colour the Popiſh Religion. Some months ſince the ſame Prelate publiſhed a Paſtoral Letter to the new Converts of this Dioceſs with the ſame deſign and intention, that is to ſeduce you, and withdraw from your eyes the Deformity and Uglineſs of the falſe Religion. They never ceaſe to commend unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49990:13"/>you, the miſchievous difficulties of Monſieur <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Book, intituled, <hi>The pretended Reformed convinced of Schiſm.</hi> There 'tis proved to you, that by the way of Examination and Inquiry, 'tis impoſſible to find out truth, and that you will never hit on it, but by ſubmitting to the Authority of the Church. Monſieur <hi>Petiſſon</hi> hath revived the ſame difficulties in a late new Book. And 'tis one of thoſe Books to which thoſe that have been ſeduced do ſend us, as one of the Sources from whence they have derived their Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Theſe Books ſhall be the ſubject matter of theſe Letters, not that I intend to examine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them line by line, but only to expoſe and lay open the falſity of theſe Teachers, the impoſture and gullery of their Sophiſms, and the unfaithfulneſs of all their advances and progreſſions, but we will not confine our ſelves within the bounds of Controverſie. We will take care to acquaint you with all things that are moſt conſiderable in this Perſecution, we will inform you in thoſe paſſages of the Life, Death, and Behaviour of our Martyrs, and Confeſſors, which are moſt proper for your eſtabliſhment, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For which reaſon we do intreat all thoſe that know any thing that is certain therein, that they will inform us concerning it, that we may make it publick for the benefit and advantage of the weak.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the Paſtoral Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> to the new Catholicks of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. We ſhall paſs by his Prologue, and engage with him in the matter of his Letter, by reflections on the manner whereby the Reformed have been brought to their pretended Change and Converſion. In the mean time I cannot forbear to ſtay one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Title thereof: <hi>The Paſtoral Letter of my Lord the Biſhop of</hi> Meaux <hi>to the new Catholicks of his Dioceſs.</hi> 'Tis one of the pretended Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, which cauſes himſelf to be Printed under the Name and Title of my Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49990:13"/>
Theſe Gentlemen are well advanced ſince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Founders of Chriſtianity, who called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves plainly by their own names, without any other Title than that of Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of our Lord. My Lords St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> had forgotten to ſet the character of their Grandeur on the front of their Paſtoral Letters or Epiſtles. If the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the World proceed ſo far as to authoriſe the cuſtom of calling Biſhops Lords, methinks their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould not be ſo great as to give themſelves that appellation. 'Tis not very edifying to ſee the marks of pride and wordly vanity on the front of a Paſtoral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I do not obſerve this, to give any offence to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> in particular; my dear Brethren, 'tis to make you ſenſible of that Religion whereinto they would initiate and engage you; 'tis a Religion the ſoul whereof is Pride, and the principal members and heads thereof are monſters of Emptineſs and Vanity. Chriſtian Humility diſplays its Characters upon all things, but the falſe Religion carries Pride to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt height, and leaves the footſteps thereof on all things wherewith it hath any converſation. We ſhall one day have occaſion to make you ſee it, in points of much more importance than this, which nevertheleſs is not ſo light, but that it deſerves that we take ſome notice of it. Do not ſuffer your ſelves to be abuſed by thoſe that tell you, That in ſome Proteſtant States the Biſhops retain the ſame Honours. The Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> have this to ſay for themſelves, That they are Peers of the Realm, to which ſtate and condition the Name and Title of My Lord doth appertain and belong: but beſides, I am perſuaded that the wiſer of theſe Gentlemen, will willingly ſacrifice theſe Titles (which do not ſufficiently beſpeak the humility of a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt) to a general Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, when it ſhall be received. On the contrary, Pride is ſo very much of the eſſence of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49990:14"/>Popery, that it will forſake all rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it.</p>
            <p>I come to the manner how Converſions are made in <hi>France</hi> according to my Lord of <hi>Meaux. I do not marvel, my deareſt Brethren, that you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in Troops,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paſtoral Letter; pag. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and with ſo much eaſe, to the Church where your Anceſtors have ſerved God. The foundation of Chriſtianity, and as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, the Character of Baptiſm, hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly called you thither.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen rejoyce at the Facility they have found in bringing back the Proteſtants to their Church, that is to ſay, in forcing Subſcriptions from an infinite number of Perſons, who have conceded either to their threatnings, or the fear of loſing their Eſtates, or the torments and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dragoons. 'Tis true there have been ſeen, examples of weakneſs therein, which have been ſtrange and prodigious; and we know that they make a great prejudice and rock of Offence thereof; they tell you, If it were the true Religion, would not thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it adhere more cloſely to it? Some of our Brethren have wrote expreſly to ſatisfie you againſt this Scandal. They have ſhewed you that things have happened much after the ſame manner in the ancient Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that Defections have fallen but little ſhort of being general. In thoſe times men ran in Troops to offer Incenſe to Idols, as in our days they have been ſeen running to make Signatures and Subſcriptions. At all times there have been few perſons capable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments. Martyrs are choſen Veſſels, upon whom God pours out an extraordinary meaſure of his Grace, to ſtrike with Aſtoniſhment the Enemies of the Truth, to ſhame and confound the weakneſs of thoſe that fall, and to ſupport the Faith of the infirm. Theſe are Miracles, but if they were frequent and ordinary they would not be ſo. If the view and conſideration of ſo many Perſons as have conceded to Violence, or the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49990:14"/>fear, of Sufferings doth ſcandalize and offend you, look not that way, but behold and conſider the ſtability and courage of your Anceſtors, which eſtabliſhed the Reformation in the laſt Age. Conſider the number of our ancient Martyrs, behold their Conſtancy, their Chriſtian Kindneſs, and the Bleſſings that they gave to thoſe that burnt them. Conſider the ſtrength which ennabled them to bear the moſt horrible Puniſhments and Tortures. They were burn'd by a ſlow fire, they ſaw their Bowels drop out in the flames, before they gave up the ghoſt: they were made to live, by skill and art, in the moſt cruel torments, ſometimes many days, and ſometimes many weeks together, and never did one word of murmuring or impatience eſcape from them: they prayed for their Hangmen, they gave Thanks to God, they ſung his Praiſes, and to their laſt breath called upon his Name. When they tell you at this day, If your Religion were true, you would adhere more cloſely unto it; anſwer them, If our Religion had been falſe, they had never had ſo invincible an Adherence to it, and ſo ſtrong a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it, nor had they ever ſuffered death for the defence of it: or if there have been ſome heady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have maintained their Opinions with obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy even to puniſhment and death, their pains and death hath not been accompanied with an humility ſo profound, a patience ſo exemplary, a love and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo perfect, a zeal ſo ardent, a piety ſo pure and undefiled, a ſubmiſſion ſo entire, a joy ſo firm, ſolid, bright and ſhining. The Spirit of Lies and Deluſions doth not produce ſuch effects. Theſe are the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of the Spirit of God, they are the effects of Grace, and of that Grace that is not given to Reprobates and Martyrs of falſhood and impoſture.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, theſe Objects are at a diſtance, they are behind you, and you will find ſome difficulty in reflecting on them, but you will find none in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49990:15"/>thoſe that are before your eyes: they are ſufficient to defend you againſt the ſcandal of that Facility wherewith they reproach you, and wherewith they affirm that your Brethren have forſaken their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Oppoſe thereunto above one hundred thouſand perſons that have left the Realm within the ſpace of one year laſt paſt, without counting almoſt as many more that have forſaken it, within twenty years that this Perſecution hath continued, tho not in its height and rage. There are among them, thoſe that have forſaken all thoſe things which are called Goods, Honours, Eaſe, and the convenient Accommodations of Life: certainly they did not find it a thing ſo eaſie to enter with a ſatisfied mind into the boſom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Oppoſe thereunto more than forty thouſand Priſoners that are in the Goals and Cloiſters of the Realm, which chuſe to ſuffer all ſorts of miſeries and calamities there, rather than to embrace the Popiſh Religion. Oppoſe thereunto Perſons of Quality; ſuch are the Marqueſs of <hi>Bordage,</hi> condemned to the Galleys, and afterwards to perpetual Impriſonment; the Marqueſs of <hi>Muſſe,</hi> who every day expects the ſame condemnation; the Marqueſs of <hi>Rochegade,</hi> and the Gentlemen his Sons; the Marqueſs of <hi>Cagni;</hi> Monſieur <hi>Beringhen</hi> and all his Family; the Marqueſs of <hi>Lunge;</hi> the Marqueſs of the <hi>Iſle of Gaſt,</hi> who is in the Citadel of <hi>Angers;</hi> and an infinite number of other Gentlemen, who prefer the Galleys or a Priſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pleaſure to which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> invites them; that is, of rejoining themſelves to that Church in which their Fathers ſerved God.</p>
            <p>Oppoſe thereunto a conſiderable number of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors, whereof ſome are in Dungeons, that are really the Images of Hell, they being deep, obſcure, dark, and a hundred feet under ground: ſuch are the Reformed of <hi>Diepe, Haure,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are in the Priſons of <hi>Aumale,</hi> of whom
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49990:15"/>we ſhall be able to tell you particular ſtories at ſome other time. Add to theſe more than ſix hundred perſons that are now actually in the Galleys for their Religion. This is no hyperbolical Computation, but one made by a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, a maritime Officer, now living at <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> we have his Letter, and without naming him, we ſhall be able to produce it at a convenient ſeaſon: behold a line or two thereof at preſent, <hi>Here are ſix hundred Gally-ſlaves of the Religion called</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>who by their patience move compaſſion from the moſt hard-hearted and unpitiful of their Officers.</hi> The number of them muſt needs be augmented ſince that time; for the Letter was dated from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> the 27th of <hi>June,</hi> 1686. that is to ſay, more than two months ſince; and without doubt there are more arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there. 'Tis newly reported, that at this time there are to the number of two thouſand, ſome ſay four thouſand, in that miſerable ſtate and caſe. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Monſieur <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Marolles,</hi> Advocate of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menehaud,</hi> was not then arrived there, for he parted not from <hi>Paris,</hi> with the other Priſoners under the ſame condemnation with himſelf, till the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> and came not to <hi>Dijon</hi> till the 30th of the ſame Month, from whence at laſt he arrived at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> laden with a Chain of fifty pound weight about his neck, and a violent Fever, which never left him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of that ſad Journey. He is a Confeſſor of Jeſus Chriſt, which all <hi>Paris</hi> beheld at the ‖ <hi>Tournello</hi> loaden with Chains of an extraordinary weight,<note place="margin">A Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and alſo a Priſon.</note> and preaching in the midſt of his Irons. All <hi>France</hi> have their eyes turned upon him, as on the greateſt example of Courage, Piety, and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience, that this Age hath ſeen. We ſhall one day give you the Hiſtory of his Confeſſion, and make you to underſtand his Sentiments by his own Letters, where you will ſee the Spirit and Character
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49990:16"/>of the ancient Martyrs. He is one of our moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Confeſſors, but he is not alone; God raiſes up others every day, as you ſhall learn hereafter. The ſame Sea-Officer that wrote from <hi>Marſeilles</hi> that there were already ſix hundred Gally-ſlaves of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion there, adds, <hi>'Tis fifteen days ſince, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> de Lezan, <hi>a Gentleman of Quality, was condemned to the Gallies, being accuſed and convicted of having been at a Meeting. The day after, many perſons were put to the Rack, to oblige them to accuſe ſome men of Name. Theſe unhappy Wretches endured both the ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Rack with ſuch a conſtancy, as affrighted the Judges, and ſoftned the Spirit of the Hangman to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the chief Magiſtrate was forced to ſtand over him with a Cane to oblige him to turn the Wheel.</hi> Behold here truth in matters of fact, which can never be doubted ſeeing they are atteſted by a perſon of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, who is upon the place, and in the Country where theſe cruelties are committed. Behold Confeſſors, which make it apparent that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not find it a thing ſo facile, (as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> reports it) to cauſe the Reformed to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Communion. Behold Examples of Conſtancy that are worthy of your moſt attentive Conſideration. Death is more eaſie to be endured than the ordinary and extraordinary Rack, and thoſe illuſtrious Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors do well deſerve the Title of Martyrs. But will you oppoſe to that Facility which your Converters find, and whereof they make an Argument to draw you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; will you, I ſay, oppoſe to your Seducers Martyrs in all forms? Oppoſe to them, Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier Viguier</hi> of <hi>Durfort</hi> in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> who was hanged in the borders or entrance into that Country ſome months ſince, in a place called <hi>La Salle,</hi> only becauſe he had ſerved God in a publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; as alſo one named <hi>Gyſot,</hi> who was burnt alive at <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rac.</hi> This poor man was ſo weak as to ſign an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49990:16"/>Abjuration of his Religion through fear and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Dragoons, or it may be through the weakneſs and infirmity of his Age, for he was more than ſeventy, and drew nigh to eighty years of age. Being fallen ſick, God reſtored to him his Zeal and Courage, that he might obtain the Crown of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. He refuſed to communicate after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and declared, That he retracted that unhappy Signature that they had extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forced from him. The Prieſt, that he might execute the Law, that ordains, that at any rate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, they muſt give the Holy Sacrament to the Sick, forced him to receive the Hoſt, or conſecrated Bread, and put it into his mouth: the old man (according to his duty) ſpit it out; and therefore was condemned to be burnt alive in the fire. He went to this horrible Puniſhment with the joy of the holy Martyrs. He was bound to the Poſt without any appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: He ſung the Praiſes of God in the midſt of the Flames to his laſt breath. This Conſtancy made ſo great an Impreſſion upon the Spirits of all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Nerac,</hi> and gave ſo great an Aſtoniſhment to the Executioners, that they have not proceeded to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a like Sentence pronounced againſt one named <hi>Fabiores,</hi> of the ſame City and of the ſame Country, condemned alſo to be burnt alive, for having, as the former, ſpit out the Hoſt, which by force was put into his mouth. We have not yet heard that the Sentence hath been executed; when 'tis done, we ſhall give you notice of it. We have a Martyr of a more ſublime and raiſed Order; 'tis Monſieur <hi>Rey</hi> of <hi>Miſmes,</hi> Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Theology, who after he had preached eight or nine months in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> was taken, arreſted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Death, and executed at <hi>Beaucaire</hi> on the 7th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The Circumſtances of his Martyrdom, his Courage, his Anſwers, his Piety, are too eminent and peculiar to be wrap'd up and buried in a ſhort Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49990:17"/>We do promiſe it you at large, when we ſhall have collected from faithful Records all the parts of the holy Hiſtory of this glorious Martyr.</p>
            <p>Behold already, my dear Brethren, many things that you have to oppoſe to thoſe Words of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux, I do not wonder that you are returned in Troops, and with ſo much facility to the Church.</hi> But this is not all; Set him matter of fact againſt this pretended Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and aſſure him, that for more than four months time there have been Aſſemblies almoſt every day in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> and in the adjacent parts, for the offering up Prayers and Supplications to God, ſometimes in Woods, and at other times in Caves, and Rocks, and Dens of the Earth. The Dragoons, which almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſurprize them, put them to the Sword according to their Inſtructions, they Kill, and Hang, and drag them into Priſons: but all ſignifies nothing, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble nevertheleſs. In the month of <hi>June</hi> laſt, near the end thereof, the Dragoons having ſurpriſed an Aſſembly near <hi>Niſmes,</hi> they killed many of them on the place, and four they hung upon the trees. The Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men withdrew, ſuppoſing that they would have no great inclination to return again to that place. But two hours after there was another Aſſembly in the ſame place, on the dead bodies, and in the view of the Carkaſſes that hung on the trees of the mountains. There is not a week paſſes without like Aſſemblies, and like Maſſacres. They reckon more than ſixty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at an Aſſembly that was made between <hi>Uzes</hi> and <hi>Bagnol</hi> in the beginning of <hi>July:</hi> ſome add, That wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were raviſhed, and others ripped up. But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the particulars of theſe things till afterwards, and you may reckon that we tell you nothing but what is true and c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtain; for which reaſon, we chuſe rather to defer the edification that you might receive from the firmneſs and conſtancy of our Martyrs <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Confeſſors, than to tell you any thing as certain that may prove
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49990:17"/>falſe. But this is enough at preſent to give the B. of <hi>Meaux</hi> and others of his ſpirit to underſtand, that they have no great cauſe to triumph in our weakneſs, and the facility they find in overcoming us. It may be they have boaſted too ſoon, they are not yet where they thought they were. We do already ſee the vanity of thoſe Bravado's, <hi>That in four months time there would not be any thing heard of a Hugonot in</hi> France. Theſe fine projects are ſhipwrecked, and the difficulty is yet to come. As for you, my Brethren, that which we ſhall ſay, and the Objects that we ſhall ſet before your eyes ought to ſhame you. If you have been ſo weak as to fall, you ought to take courage, and riſe again, and to redouble your ſtrength, if you have not had enough to ſupport you hitherunto. But let us continue to hear the Paſtoral Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not one of you hath ſuffered violence, either in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Goods. Let them not bring you theſe deceitful Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are addreſſed from Strangers, transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paſtors, under the Title of Paſtoral Letters to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of</hi> France, <hi>who are fallen by the force of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Theſe Letters concern you not any otherwiſe than as they are made by perſons that could never prove their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. So far have you been from ſuffering torments, that you have not ſo much as heard them mentioned. I hear other Biſhops ſay the ſame. But for you, my Brethren, I ſay nothing to you, but what you may ſpeak as well as I. You are returned peaceably to us, you know it.</hi> Behold one of thoſe objects, whereunto we have not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. <hi>Maimbourg, Varillas, Brueys,</hi> and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of others have had the front to ſay, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions are made without violence. On that ſubject they have been baffled in a manner ſufficient to have covered impudence it ſelf with confuſion. But 'tis to waſh the Blackmoor's skin. Theſe Gentlemen have Foreheads of Braſs, and can bluſh at nothing. By this little judge of the fidelity of your Converters.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49990:18"/>You that have ſeen your Goods waſted, your Perſons contained, your Neighbours dragged to Priſons, Women ſhaven, and put into Convents, Chriſtians let down into Holes, where putrified Fleſh and Carrion had been thrown. Others put into Priſons, where the Water runs under their feet, being ſupported by nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row planks, upon which they are mounted night and day, leſt they fall as from a Precipice, and periſh. Others have been burnt and roaſted, and others made fools by watching them without ceſſation or intermiſſion.</p>
            <p>All <hi>France</hi> hath ſeen it, all <hi>Europe</hi> is witneſs of it, and they dare affirm the contrary to what your eyes have ſeen. Do you think that theſe Gentlemen dare not lye about the Ages paſt, when they ſpeak to you of Tradition, and of things ſaid and done a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and twelve hundred years agone, when they have no regard to preſent Truths in matters of Fact, whereof there are as many Witneſſes almoſt as there are perſons alive in this part of the World. In the name of God think of it, when they forbid you all tryal and examination of Doctrines, and tell you that you muſt believe the Church; that is to ſay, falſe Teachers, which affirm, that you muſt believe things without taking any knowledge of them. See, I ſay, whether there be any confidence or truſt to be put in ſuch men which have conſecrated themſelves to Lying, and have renounced all modeſty and ſhame.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath heard all the Biſhops ſay, that no violence was uſed in their Dioceſſes. We ought to underſtand how theſe Gentlemen do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Violence, and what 'tis they call Torments. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Biſhops, he of <hi>Autun</hi> will find difficulty to ſay ſo, and Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> that thoſe of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had not ſo much as heard of Torments. He went accompanied with the Hangman to Madam <hi>de S. Andrew Montbrun,</hi> Widow of a famous General, which had the Honor to command in chief the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49990:18"/>of the King, and thoſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with a great deal of Glory. This Biſhop, I ſay, with the Miſſionaries, accompanied with the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the Magiſtrate taking two or three Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with all the Inſtruments of Torture, went thus to endeavour her Converſion. If this be falſe, they will do well to convince the Men and Officers of her Houſe, which have ſeen, ſaid it, and writ it. But the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> hath done nothing, nor ſeen nothing of like nature in his Dioceſs. We have good teſtimony that violence hath been committed there as well as elſewhere. But altho what he ſays ſhould be true, behold a great marvel whereof he hath great reaſon to rejoice! <hi>Paris</hi> and the Country round about it were laſt of all attacked. All <hi>France</hi> had been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Fear, Tears and Blood. <hi>Paris</hi> and the <hi>Brie</hi> ſaw nothing round about but bloody Troops, and Emiſſaries loaden with the Spoils of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and red with their Blood. 'Tis a great Miracle, that theſe Objects, without drawing nearer have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and overcome them. As if the fear of an Evil, which one ſees within four ſteps of him, were not as capable of doing violence to the mind, as the Evils which are felt immediately. On the contrary, a perſon has fallen under fear, which hath reſiſted pain and torment. The Dragoons of <hi>Bearn,</hi> of <hi>Guienne,</hi> of <hi>Poictou,</hi> of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> had laboured for the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux.</hi> After that let him glory if he can, of the Facility of Converſions.</p>
            <p>But I am weary of confuting theſe impudent Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes by matters of fact, which our Perſecutors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, and by Witneſſes which they reproach. Let us ſee if Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> will reproach and object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf. He wrote his Paſtoral Letter in the Month of <hi>April</hi> laſt, a little before Eaſter, to invite, and prepare the new Converts for the approaching Communion. 'Tis preciſely on the ſame time that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49990:19"/>he wrote to one of his Dioceſs which was fled, the Letter following.</p>

                  <p>I Continue to write to you, notwithſtanding the Anſwer you made to my former Letter. I have there obſerved a Character and Style too much of a Miniſter, to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to you. In a word, I apprehend, that it does not proceed from a Spirit ſuch as yours. But altho it be ſo, I ſhall not ceaſe to invite you to return. I have ſeen in a Letter which you wrote to Mademoiſelle of <hi>U.</hi> that the true Church does not perſecute. What underſtand you by that Sir? Do you underſtand that the Church by her ſelf never makes uſe of force? That is very true, ſince the Church hath no other Arms but ſpiritual. Do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Princes, which are Sons of the Church, never ought to make uſe of the Sword which God hath put into their hands to abaſe the Enemies thereof? Do you dare to ſay contrary to the opinion of your own Doctors, who have maintained by ſo many Writings, that the Republick of <hi>Geneva</hi> had power and right to condemn <hi>Servetus</hi> to the Fire, for denying the Divinity of the Son of God. And without ſerving my ſelf of the Examples, and Authority of your Doctors, tell me in what Text of Scripture Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Schiſmaticks are excepted from the number of thoſe Malefactors againſt which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays God hath armed Kings and Princes? And altho you will not permit Chriſtian Princes to take vengeance of ſuch great Crimes, becauſe they are injurious to God, can they not take vengeance on them becauſe they cauſe trouble and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in States? Do you not ſee clearly, that you build upon a falſe Principle? And if it were true, they were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49990:19"/>the <hi>Arrians, Neſtorians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians</hi> which had reaſon of complaint againſt the Church, ſince it was they that were the perſecuted and baniſhed, and Catholick Princes thoſe that perſecuted and baniſhed them. And at preſent alſo the Catholicks which are puniſhed with death in <hi>Sueden,</hi> and ſo many other Kingdoms, would have reaſon to complain of thoſe that are called the Reformed, and every one in his turn would have right and wrong, right in one place, and wrong in another, and Religion would depend altogether upon uncertainties. But this is enough on this Subject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſo good a Spirit as yours. Only know, that when it pleaſes God to abandon us to our own thoughts, and imaginations, the beſt Spirits are touched, and affected by the leaſt appearances. The fear that you have, that they will make you adore Bread, hath much appearance of truth through your prejudice and prepoſſeſſion. Conſider in the mean time, without entring into that Controverſie, which paſſes the Bounds of a Letter; conſider, I ſay, that it was a fear of like nature which made the <hi>Arrians</hi> and Diſciples of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> that they would not give divine Honors to a Man, an Infant, a Creature, how perfect, and how great ſoever his privileges might be. 'Twas human reaſon, 'twas ſenſe, 'twas prejudice which inſpired them with theſe vain fears. Take heed, leſt your Religion, after their example, do not too much call in Reaſon and human Senſe to its ſuccour, and that your trouble and difficulty do not proceed from the cuſtom of following them. However it be, you ſee that your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers have done nothing elſe but renew Controverſies ended ſix hundred years ago, when <hi>Berengarius</hi> moved them. And if you call in doubt the Judgment which was given againſt him, others will doubt with as much reaſon concerning all preceding Councils, and then behold us under an obligation to examine anew all that hath been decreed, as if we began to be Chriſtians, and all that our Fathers had reſolved ſerve for nothing. In one word
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49990:20"/>the meaning is, if Chriſtians, when they are not of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the Senſe of Scripture, will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a living, ſpeaking Authority, to which they muſt ſubmit, the Chriſtian Church is aſſuredly the weakeſt of all Societies that are in the World, the moſt expoſed to remedileſs Diviſions, the moſt abandoned to Innovators, and factious perſons. This is that to which your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with all their ſubtleties have never been able to find an Anſwer, and they content themſelves with bringing Examples, where they pretend that Councils have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways determined well. All theſe Examples are falſe or ill alledged. In one quarter of an hours time, you which are a Man of Senſe, will be convinced thereof; and you do receive things with too much credulity, without ever put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your ſelf on the labor to examine them. But without putting you upon theſe Diſquiſitions, conſider only whether it be likely that God who hath permitted ſo many depths in the Scripture, and from thence have ariſen ſo many Schiſms amongſt thoſe that profeſs to receive it, hath not left ſome means to his Church to quiet and pacifie them, in ſuch manner, that there is no remedy for Diviſions, but to let every one believe according to his fancy, and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly to carry Men to an indifferency in Religion, which is the greateſt of all Evils. Think, Maſter, think of it, hear your own reaſon, and not the ſubtleties of your Miniſters, who at what rate ſoever will defend their Prejudices, and not paſs for Teachers of Lies. Think of theſe things: excuſe thoſe Expreſſions which may ſeem a little dark and diſordered; it is much better that you attend to the ſimplicity of a Brother that endeavours to gain a Brother, than a polite and ſtudied Diſcourſe. Come, and aſſure your ſelf, that I will do all for you, whom I eſteem, and who are dear to me; and that I am cordially</p>

            <p>THE neceſſity of concluding, hindered us in our former Letter from adding our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon that which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> wrote to one of his Dioceſs that was eſcaped by flight. At preſent we entreat both you my Brethren, and all reaſonable Men in the World, to compare theſe two Letters together, the Paſtoral Letter that is publick, and this which is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and particular. Will any one find the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> here? Are they two perſons, or is it but one? Himſelf in publick, and the ſame perſon in private. According to Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Writing, and Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the new Converts of his Dioceſs, neither he nor the other Biſhops have ever heard any ſpeech of Dragoons and Torments. According to himſelf writing in his Cloſet to a particular perſon, the Caſe

It is true there is a Perſecution for the ſake of Religion, but it is juſt, it is allowed, it is authoriſed by our example, by that of the Ancients, and by Divine and Human Laws. Good God! How do theſe Men govern themſelves? And what do they think? Could the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> ever hope that his Printed Letter ſhould never fall into the hands of him to whom this written Letter was addreſſed? I would fain know what will be anſwered thereunto. If Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> hath right and reaſon on his ſide, in his Letter to Monſieur <hi>Dev.—</hi> why doth he ſay that himſelf and other Biſhops have not heard any ſpeech of Perſecution? It is a pleaſure, and an advantage to us to ſee theſe Gentlemen deny this Perſecution, and thereby againſt publick knowledge, and notoriety charge themſelves with falſhood. It is an homage that they pay to Truth. It is a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion intelligible enough, that violence, and the means that they employ, are contrary to the ſpirit of Humanity, and that of the Goſpel. But what a ſhame is it for them to contradict themſelves, to confeſs in private, what they deny in publick, and acknowledge themſelves falſe Witneſſes by their own peoples declarations.</p>
            <p>However it be, behold us carried from matter of Fact to that of Right. It is no longer debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Perſecution, but whether they have right to Perſecute for the ſake of Religion. It is a queſtion on which ſo much hath been lately written, that nothing new can be ſaid concerning it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, having Printed the Letter of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and becauſe there is ſomthing that is dazling, and apt to deceive in his manner of writing, we think our ſelves obliged to Print alſo a refutation thereof: we will therefore repeat his words, and examine them one after another. <hi>I have ſeen in the Letter that you wrote to</hi> Mademoiſelle de V.— <hi>that the true
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49990:22"/>Church doth not Perſecute; what underſtand you by that Monſieur? Do you underſtand that the Church by it ſelf never makes uſe of force? That is true, ſince the Church hath no other Arms but thoſe that are Spiritual.</hi> What means this little Paragraph of Gibberiſh, which is formed and contrived on purpoſe to impoſe upon the ſimple? They are willing that it ſhould mean, that it is not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that raiſes the preſent Perſecution, nor is it according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples thereof. For it is that which they perſuade the new Converts. It is by this means that they take away the ſcandal that the new Papiſts take at the Conduct of their Church. It is the King, ſay they, that doth it, it is not the Church, for it ſerves it ſelf only of Spiritual Weapons: if what is done be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, it ought not to be imputed, they ſay, to their Religion, which neither appoints nor adviſes it. That which was written to us not long ſince, by one of their moſt illuſtrious, and beſt ſatisfied Converts comes to this. <hi>I do not anſwer,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>to all that which you have ſaid concerning the ways that are made uſe of to gain Converts. I believe that nothing is to be imputed to any Religion, but what it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points to be believed, and practiſed.</hi> This anſwer is very Gentile, and worthy of a Lady that thinks her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to anſwer to nothing. But it ought to be rememembred that there is a Tribunal where an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers muſt be made one day, without any regard to the difference of Sexes, where no evaſions will be permitted us, and that we ſhall be puniſhed there, for having been unwilling to attend to thoſe things which might have made us underſtand the nature of that Religion that we had newly entertained. However it be, theſe Gentlemen perſuade their Diſciples that it is not the Spirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that doth cauſe this Perſecution. <hi>Nothing muſt be imputed to any Religion, but what it appoints to be believed. The
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49990:22"/>Church never ſerves it ſelf of force, for it hath no other Arms, but ſuch as are Spiritual.</hi> There is among the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, on the one hand, an impudence, and hardneſs of Face, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, and on the other hand there is in their Diſciples an abyſs of credulity that is incomprehenſible. Can hardineſs, and ſhameleſneſs be greater than to ſay that Perſecution is not of the ſpirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. One of our<note n="*" place="margin">See the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctor <hi>Sonſtelle.</hi>
               </note> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre hath written concerning it a little while ſince, with ſo much brevity that every one may read it, and with ſo much ſtrength as to convince them of the falſhood thereof. We prove that the Perſecution is of the ſpirit of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by its Principles, its Doctrine, and its Practice. I do not know whether there can be any other ſource, or fountain of proofs, when we treat of matters of Fact. The Principles of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church are, that all thoſe that are ſeparate from their Church are damned eternally. Its Doctrine is that the Secular Power, with Fire and Sword, may be employed for the extirpation of thoſe that ſhe calls Hereticks. The Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which <hi>France</hi> eſteems as the moſt Authentick, that hath been theſe thouſand years, hath ſo determined, and ſo it pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. For it cauſed <hi>John Lous,</hi> and <hi>Jerome Oſprague,</hi> to be burned. The <hi>Albigenſes, Waldenſes, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> and many others were not Maſſacred but by order of Councils, and Popes who publiſhed <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadoes</hi> againſt them, and gave Indulgences, and promiſed Pardon of ſin to thoſe that ſhould deſtroy them. The Tribunal of the Inquiſition, which burns all thoſe that are either ſuſpected, or Convicted of Hereſie, is a Tribunal of the Church, eſtabliſhed, and maintained thereby; and it is looked on by the Popes as the great Rampart and Defence thereof. Never were there any Maſſacres committed which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49990:23"/>were not either Commanded, or Approved by Popes. They are matters of Fact notoriouſly known, and no body dares to diſſent unto them. <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſung <hi>Te Deum,</hi> that is, <hi>We praiſe thee</hi> O <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. and given thanks to him for the Perſecution of <hi>France.</hi> Nothing is more proper to make known what is the Spirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, than the Conduct of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> We have ſaid that the Pope publickly commends what hath been done in <hi>France,</hi> and hath cauſed <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung for it. In the mean time it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all Men of good ſenſe in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> do both deteſt, and ſcoff at the Conduct of <hi>France.</hi> Whence comes it then that this Court ſeems to approve in publick, that which it condemns in private. It is not to flatter the King, for they have no reſpect or regard for him in that Country, and every one knows the indignation that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But it is becauſe that <hi>Rome</hi> dares not declare againſt the Principles of their Religion. If the Pope ſhould condemn ways of violence againſt pretended Hereticks, he would mutiny his whole Church againſt himſelf, and make himſelf worthy of depoſition. He would condemn his Councils, he would reproach the memory of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, he would overturn his own Principles from top to bottom. So that the publick approbation which he gives to Perſecution, is the Sacrifice which he makes of his Conſcience, to his duty in quality of a Pope. But like a Man of good ſenſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the right of condemning in private all that which he publickly approves. The Letter of the Queen of <hi>Sueden,</hi> which hath been made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the News of the Republick of Learning, hath conjectured diſcreetly concerning it. For it is not to be believed that Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> would dare ſo openly to declare her ſelf againſt the Sentiments of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> if that Court had approved of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49990:23"/>this manner of Converſions. Behold a ſecond Letter of the ſame Queen, which tells us ſomething more exact, concerning the Sentiments which prevail in the Country where ſhe is.</p>

            <p>It behoves us to ſpeak as the caſe is, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> diſapproves the conduct of the King, becauſe it is his Enemy. The Perſecution is of no value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis he that doth it: However it be, we are in no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49990:24"/>condition in <hi>France</hi> to make uſe of the moderate Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Italy.</hi> For the <hi>Galican</hi> Church hath renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this moderation. She pays Men of Learning, to prove that ways of Violence are permitted.</p>
            <p>At this day all the Realm is full of Writers, which labour to juſtifie, <hi>compel them to come in.</hi> They quote S. <hi>Auguſtin;</hi> they report his opinions concerning the Perſecution that was raiſed againſt the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> 'Tis notorious that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Perſecution. They cannot deny that they have drawn up all the Edicts, and that they have ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited the execution of them; ſo that we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how the Converters can endure that their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſhould ſay, <hi>That we ought not to impute any thing to a Religion, but that which it appoints to be believed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not appoint any Violence to be practiſed againſt Hereticks.</p>
            <p>But the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> finds a very pleaſant means to juſtifie her, <hi>the Church never ſerves it ſelf with force by it ſelf,</hi> ſays he, that is to ſay, it calls to her ſuccour the ſecular Power to cut off Heads, to hang, and burn; therefore it ought not to be imputed to her. A So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Magiſtrate contents himſelf to be Judg, and to condemn to Death, but he doth not execute, he leaves that to the Hangman; by conſequence, if he condemn the Innocent and cauſe them to die, it ought to be imputed to the Hangman, and not to him. The Church doth a very fine honour to Magiſtrates, ſhe makes them her Hangmen; ſhe herſelf doth not kill, but ſhe conſtrains Princes to kill and burn. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains, I ſay, by Excommunications, Cenſures, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Seductions, Sollicitations; and the end thereof is, ſhe would be able to ſay, <hi>The Church dips not her hand in Blood, the Church by it ſelf never makes uſe of force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did the Devil ever cheat after a more impudent and frontleſs manner? I will not ſay after a more fine and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til manner; for it is to lye without any hope to deceive, the Snare is ſo broad and ſo ridiculous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49990:24"/>
It were better without Craft to take the way that the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> takes at laſt, and to maintain that Chriſtian Princes, as ſuch, have right to puniſh pretended Hereticks with Death. <hi>Underſtand you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>That Princes who are Sons of the Church, never ought to make uſe of the Sword to abuſe the Enemies thereof? Do you dare to ſay contrary to the opinion of your Doctors, which have maintaind by ſo many Writings, that the Republick of</hi> Geneva, <hi>had power and right to condemn</hi> Servetus <hi>to the Fire for having denied the Divinity of the Son of God?</hi> It muſt be avowed that theſe Gentlemen are admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their confidence. <hi>Do you dare to ſay?</hi> Yes we dare to ſay it, ſince we ſay it with moſt part of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and with the wiſeſt and moſt underſtanding of the Moderns. We dare ſay that the Doctrine which the B. of <hi>Meaux</hi> maintains here, is bloody and cruel, and that the Church ought to leave it in ſhare to him who was a Liar and Murderer from the beginning. <hi>Servetus</hi> was burnt at <hi>Geneva,</hi> therefore it is lawful to burn Hugonots, and the Calviniſts. God forgive theſe unhappy men which have the Cruelty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us with <hi>Servetus.</hi> This man was not only an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, but he was an Enemy of all Divinity, he was impious, he was a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer. And although he made profeſſion of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one God, the irreverent manner wherewith he ſpeaks of Holy Myſteries, makes it plain enough, that he had renounced all Religion as well as all Shame. It ought to be permitted us to quit our hands of ſuch men. They object unto us the Sentiment of our Doctors. I anſwer, Our Doctors never did believe that we ought to perſecute and burn men that confeſs God and Jeſus Chriſt, according to the three Creeds. They never put Papiſts to Death for the ſake of their Religion. But although ſome of our firſt Writers ſhould have gone too far in ſpeaking concerning the puniſhment of Hereticks; it ought to be known, that our Authors
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49990:25"/>are not our Teachers; we have but one only Teacher, and that is Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaking by his Prophets and Apoſtles. We ſwear to no mans words, but to thoſe of God. <hi>And without ſerving my ſelf of the Examples and Authority of your Doctors, tell me in what place of Scripture Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are excepted from the number of thoſe Malefactors, againſt whom S.</hi> Paul <hi>hath ſaid, that God hath armed Kings and Princes?</hi> It apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not to us to ſhew you, that Hereticks are not of the number of thoſe againſt which God hath put a Sword in the hands of Princes. 'Tis for you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Perſecutors, to prove to us that they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended there: For we have ſenſe, reaſon, piety, and humanity on our ſide; and beſides, we have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſound Antiquity, for more than four hundred years. How could the Church be able to put the Sword in the hand of Magiſtrates for the puniſhment of her Enemies, in a time when the moſt ſcrupulous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians found it difficult to conſent to the Death of thoſe Criminals that diſturbed the publick peace, and that of particular perſons, and did maintain, that Chriſtians without exception, never ought to dip their hands in Blood.</p>
            <p>In what Dictionary hath Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> found, that evil thinkers and evil doers are the ſame thing? Princes have right to puniſh evil doers with Death, therefore they have alſo right to puniſh evil thinkers with Death. They have right to puniſh thoſe whoſe Crimes are apparent to the publick ruine, therefore they have right to burn men whoſe Crime is in the Conſcience, the Empire whereof appertains only to God. If the Church have right to call in the Secular Power for the puniſhment of Hereticks, why did S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay ſimply, <hi>A man that is an Heretick reject, after the firſt and ſecond admonition?</hi> Why did he not ſay, <hi>Deliver him to the ſecular Power that he may be burnt?</hi> Did he not know, that in a few Ages Princes would
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49990:25"/>become Chriſtians, and have the Sword in their hands? Did he only give Precepts for the preſent time and ſtate? Hath this Cruelty of Maſſacring honeſt, well-meaning, but miſtaken Perſons, any affinity with the Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt, which commands us to ſerve our ſelves with Sweetneſs, Humanity, Prayers, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and reaſons for the reduction of them? It is then permitted to Maſſacre the Jews, for there are none greater Enemies to the Church than they are. Is that the Spirit of the Goſpel which promiſes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and converſion to that Nation? How ſhall they return if they be deſtroyed? Will men never be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of this Antichriſtian Barbarity? Will they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know that it is the Beaſt in the Revelations, who makes himſelf drunk with the Blood of Saints, devours their Fleſh, makes War upon them and overcomes them, and is therefore called <hi>Beaſt, Lion, Bear,</hi> and <hi>Leopard.</hi> For he muſt have renounced reaſon and humanity, and be transformed into a Savage Beaſt, that behaves himſelf towards Chriſtians, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> behaves it ſelf towards us.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> affirms, that what they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us at this day, is nothing but a lawful exerciſe of the Power that Princes enjoy by Authority from God, for the puniſhment of Offenders. And I will prove to him in three words, that it is falſe. 1. Princes in the uſe of the Sword againſt Malefactors deſign their ruin; that publick Societies be no more troubled with them. 'Twas the end that was heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Perſecutions for Religion. 'Twas the end that <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth pretended to have in the Maſſacre of S. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> 'Tis the end of the Inquiſitors who burn all thoſe that are ſuſpected of Hereſie. It hath been the end of all Perſecutors in paſt Ages. But this is not their end at this day; they intend not the Deſtruction of the pretended Hereticks, but their Converſion: Therefore although it ſhould be true,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49990:26"/>that Hereticks are not eccepted out of the number of thoſe Malefactors, againſt whom God hath armed Princes; this will be only a power granted to puniſh them, not to endeavour their Converſion by Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Tis an abominable means of Converſion, which only makes Hypocrites. 'Tis ſufficiently known, that reaſon cannot be gained thereby: The purging of Societies is the end of the Sword; but Perſecution at the rate that it is at this day managed, will corrupt and ruine Societies by filling them with ſecret Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who will diſperſe their Venom in a manner by ſo much the more dangerous, by how much it is more private and ſecret. What is there therefore of likeneſs between their treatment of us? Is the lawful uſe of the Sword againſt Malefactors? Do not lightly paſs over what I have now ſaid, but give attention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. If that which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> hath ſaid, to prove that Heretiques are not excepted out of the number of thoſe Malefactors, that Princes are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to puniſh, ſeem a little to ſtartle you; tell him that is not the queſtion; it is not debated whether ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Hereticks may not be puniſhed with Death; his Catholick Authors do affirm it: But we would learn whether they ought to extort Subſcriptions, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Communions profane and ſacrilegious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe joyned with Hypocriſie and Incredulity; by Force, Plunder, Violence, and all kind of Torments. Now that is it which all the World with one accord condemn, and is abominable, according to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the rigid <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as well as our own: 'Tis that which the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> have lately invented and practiſed, and 'tis that which will render their preſent conduct, the horror of all future Ages.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The uſe of the Sword that God hath put into the hands of Princes, hath Juſtice and Righteouſneſs for the reaſon and foundation of it, for it is for the exerciſe of it; and ſecondly, Fidelity and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49990:26"/>for it is to preſerve and maintain it. But that which is perpetrated upon us at this day, is an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted courſe of Iniquities, Acts of injuſtice, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, fraud, falſhood, breach of Promiſes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Edicts, violation of Oaths, and of all things that can be imagined moſt horrid and affrightning. Doth not this well reſemble the Sword of good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces armed againſt Sins and Crimes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To conclude, the uſe of the Sword for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and avenging the rights of God, preſerves alſo the rights of Men. It hath for its end the honour of God, and the ſalvation of Souls: For Juſtice is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed for the ſalvation of the Souls of the wicked, by the puniſhment of their Bodies. But in the preſent Perſecution, they neither reſpect or regard the rights of God, or the ſalvation of the Soul, but only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King. They labour plainly, not for the ſalvation, but damnation of Souls; and they take all imaginable care to make it ſure. There is no man that is not ignorant of what is done, to whom what I have ſaid will ſeem an extravagance and exceſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But behold the proof thereof: The Dragoons come into a Town or Village, and without any ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent inſtruction, demand in the Name of the King, from all the Inhabitants thereof, Subſcription and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration, on penalty of waſting their Goods, beating, impriſoning, and torturing their Bodies with all other evils except Death. All the People faint and fall, they own the Romiſh Religion without believing it; they ſign the Condemnation of their own, they ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize and damn <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers. He goes to Confeſſion, he goes to Maſs, he communicates, he adores the Bread, he aſſiſts at the invocation of Saints, and outwardly conſents to that Worſhip that they give to Images. He believes none of all this, but abhors it at his Heart. In the mean time they are content, they have all that they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49990:27"/>deſire, and they demand no more. Now what have they made? They have made Hypocrites that ſay one thing and think another, prophane perſons that hate what they adore; Idolaters, that worſhip what they account Creatures, and the workmanſhip of mens hands. Behold what they have done, and what they have deſired to do. For to ſay, that by the Dragoons, they deſired the Calviniſts to renounce their Hereſie, is the moſt: fooliſh of all extravagances; 'tis well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough known, that they are no proper Arguments to perſwade: Therefore they intended and deſired to make Hypocrites, profane, ſacrilegious perſons, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Sacraments and Idolaters. Now if theſe men be not in the high way to Damnation, I know not who are. So therefore plainly the end of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, 'tis to damn men.</p>
            <p>But behold farther I do maintain that they take all kinds of ſecurity to be certain of the damnation of the new Converts when they die. This appears by the Declaration of the nineteenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1686, by which it is appointed, <hi>That if any of our Subjects of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex, which have abjured the pretended Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, happening to be ſick, do refuſe to receive the Sacrament of the Church, from the Curates, Vicars, and other Prieſts, I do declare, that they will perſiſt, and die in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reformed Religion. In caſe the ſaid ſick perſons do recover their health, Proceſs being made againſt them by our Judges, they ſhall be condemned, if they be Men, to make honorable ſatisfaction, and to the Gallies for ever, with confiſcation of their Goods; and if they be Women, or Daughters, to make honorable ſatisfaction, and be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, with confiſcation of their Goods.</hi> This is the Declaration that the Prieſts make to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that thinks himſelf on his Death-bed, when he refuſes to communicate. There is no Man ſo ſick but he may recover. He that at firſt (according to his own conſcience) refuſes to communicate after the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49990:27"/>manner of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, at length begins to think, that if he recovers, he muſt away to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: theſe thoughts affright him, and as the Diſeaſe of the Body increaſes the weakneſs of his mind, he falls under the fear of that hideous puniſhment that muſt laſt as long as life. He communicates, again he abjures the Truths which are in his heart, he adores that which he believes to be but Bread, he is profane in hating an holy thing, he is ſacrilegious in uſurping the Sacraments, he is an Idolater in worſhiping a Creature. The Prieſt which hath ſeen him in theſe Conflicts, in theſe long Oppoſitions, in his Refuſals to communicate, in Acts of Incredulity, and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for theſe Miſeries, conſtrains him by fear, and the Declaration of the King. Thereby he gains an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the damnation of this wretch, and makes him dye in the moſt fearful diſpoſitions in which a perſon can die. Theſe are no far fetched conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, to diſcern them their needs neither Natural nor Artificial Logick. This is to cauſe him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce God before Death hath ſtabbed him at the Heart. All the World were ſtruck with horror by the Declaration of the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> laſt, which condemned all thoſe, that ſhould make any uſe of the Reformed Religion, to death. They cryed out that at this ſtroke the Perſecutors could no more diſtinguiſh the Conduct of this day, from that of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. and <hi>Henry</hi> II. They ſaid that never did any Perſecution proceed further than blood, and that there was no further pretence to ſay, that they ſerved themſelves with moderate ways for our Converſion: but this Declaration of the month of <hi>July,</hi> is nothing in compariſon of that of the month of <hi>April,</hi> for I dare ſay that Hell never produced any thing more horrible. I impute not this to the Supream Powers, who have ſuffered themſelves to be ſurpriſed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuch an Edict. A ſpirit ſo imployed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49990:28"/>of finiſhing his Work, as is that of our King, is not capable of giving attention to any thing elſe. But I impure it to the Counſel of Conſcience, to the Biſhops, and Jeſuits which draw up the Decrees, and cauſe them to be ſigned with blinded Eyes. I do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that never was there any Society gave ſo great marks and ſigns of reprobation, as that which forms and executes theſe projects. After that Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> hath ſaid that that which is done at preſent, is an exerciſe of the right Fidelity and Juſtice that Princes have to imploy the Sword for the puniſhment of Malefactors. Let us ſee how he goes on, <hi>And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you will not permit to Chriſtian Princes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge great Crimes, becauſe they are injurious to God, may they not revenge them becauſe they cauſe trouble and Sedition in the State?</hi> Without doubt thoſe that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the State of what Religion ſoever they be, be they Orthodox, or otherwiſe, may be puniſhed. But who are theſe that trouble the State, are they thoſe which Kill, which Maſſacre, and Plunder, or thoſe which live peaceably, and demand nothing but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to worſhip God according to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and agreeably to the Edicts which have been granted them, with all ſorts of promiſes and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? What trouble do we make in the State? What evil have we done in putting the Crown in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and in hindering it from falling from the Head of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. during his minority? Where are our Seditions and Revolts? <hi>Europe</hi> knows and ſees who they are which trouble the State, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, or they which lay waſt the Provinces, which diminiſh the Revenues of the King, which weaken and aboliſh Trade, and force more than a million of ſouls to ſearch out ways to get out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> adds. <hi>Do you not clearly ſee that you build upon a falſe Principle? If it were true they were the</hi> Arrians, <hi>the</hi> Neſtorians, <hi>and the</hi> Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49990:28"/>
               <hi>that had reaſon to complain of the Church, ſeeing they were thoſe which were Baniſhed, and Perſecuted, and Catholick Princes were thoſe that did Perſecute and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of all, I ſay, that they rendered to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> no more but what they had done to the Church. They had removed, and chaſed away the Orthodox from their Churches: they had Baniſhed the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and they Baniſhed them. Secondly, I anſwer that it is falſe, that Catholick Princes ever did that againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that is this day done againſt us. Let Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> a little unfold his skill in Hiſtory, and let him make us ſee, that the Emperors did ſend Armies into the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Villages, and by the moſt cruel treatments force Abjuration. Let him make us ſee, that they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſubſcriptions, that they did beat, impriſon, ſend to the Mines, or Gallies, thoſe that refuſed it. To conclude, I ſay, that there is a great deal of difference between Baniſhing, and Tormenting of Hereticks. A Prince that will preſerve his State clean may ſend Hereticks, whoſe Doctrine he would not have diſperſed, with their Families, and Goods elſewhere. If the King had been contented to have Baniſhed us with our Families and Goods, we had had ſubject of complaint, becauſe of the falſe opinion, that they have entertained concerning us; that we are Hereticks, doth not give them any right to treat us as ſuch, and to break the Confederations made with us, and our Anceſtors. But nevertheleſs we would have ſuffered this injuſtice patiently, becauſe it would have been nothing in compariſon of what is done againſt us at this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And at preſent alſo the Catholicks which are puniſhed with death in</hi> Sueden, <hi>and ſo many other Kingdoms, would have reaſon of complaint againſt thoſe that call themſelves Reformed, and every one in his turn would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49990:29"/>have right and wrong, right in one place, and wrong in another, and Religion would depend upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> be diſpleaſed, it is not honeſt to advance matters of Fact ſo barbarous as theſe without any proof, yea matters of Fact the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity whereof are notorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They puniſh the Catholicks in</hi> Sueden, <hi>and many other Countries with death.</hi> I demand for the Publick, in the Age preſent, and in the Age to come, Juſtice for this Calumny. Nothing is more falſe, and more known to be ſo, for there is not a Proteſtant State, where the Papiſts have not permiſſion to live, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Conſcience, although in ſome places they have not the publick exerciſe of their Religion, and they are very few: I know not whether <hi>Sueden</hi> be one of them. The reſt of that period, <hi>every one has right and wrong,</hi> &amp;c. is a Riddle which-covers at the bottom the moſt frightful Doctrine that ever was publiſhed. It is that every Prince in his Dominions hath right to exterminate by Fire, and Sword, all thoſe which are not of his Religion. It is the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Law, which according to Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> ought to be the ſame every where, to the end that it be not expoſed to uncertainties. It is, I ſay, the moſt horrible Doctrine that a Chriſtian can teach. For according to it, the <hi>Turks</hi> have right to cut the Throats of Chriſtians in all places where they are Maſters. Behold the argument of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> weakned and overturned, if I do not miſtake; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it is certain that it comprehends in brief the beſt of all which theſe Gentlemen have to ſay on that behalf.</p>
            <p>I had deſigned to leave the reſt of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> his Letter, becauſe the Chapter concerning the Adoration of the Euchariſt, and that of the Judge of Controverſies, which he touches tranſiently, will
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49990:29"/>have their place in the following Letters, and there be handled ſomthing at large. But I have thought, that the Readers love to find an Antidote wherever they find Poiſon, for which reaſon we will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereon, that the weakneſs of what he doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance may appear, to the end that they may not be impoſed upon by theſe appearances of demonſtration.</p>
            <p>He touches the Adoration of the Bread, and ſays, <hi>The fear that you have that they will make you adore Bread, hath ſome appearance of truth according to your prejudice.</hi> I am well pleaſed that they do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that our fear hath ſome appearance of truth at leaſt. If the real preſence were engravers in the Scripture as with a beam of the Sun, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in producing thoſe words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> our fear would have no foundation. To defend us againſt this prejudice, Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> produces the falſe fear of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and the Diſciples of <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus,</hi> who feared <hi>leſt they ſhould be made to worſhip a Man, an Infant, a Creature, however perfect, and highly priviledged he were.</hi> Let not Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> be diſpleaſed, behold a ſhred of Antiquity ill placed, and diſpoſed for a perſon, that prides himſelf of knowledg. It ſuppoſes that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> have heretofore refuſed to adore Jeſus Chriſt, under pretence that he was a Creature, a Man, an Infant, juſt as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe at this day to adore the Sacrament under pretence that it is but Bread. I would be very glad that he would a little ſhew us thoſe places in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, where the <hi>Arrians</hi> refuſed to adore Jeſus Chriſt becauſe he was nothing elſe but Man. Firſt of all they did not ſay he was a mere Man, they acknowledged he was <hi>God of God, and Light of Light,</hi> and that he was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they ſaid he was a God created before all Ages, and afterwards incarnate. And as for the adoration, they ſo little refuſed to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49990:30"/>give it to Jeſus Chriſt, that all the Fathers made it their Crime, and convinced them of Idolatry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuppoſing Jeſus Chriſt was a Creature, they nevertheleſs adored him. It is good my Brethren, that you obſerve this paſſage, and that you conclude that theſe-Gentlemen know not how to quote the Ancients, without impreſſing ſome footſteps of their falſneſs and perfidiouſneſs on thoſe quotations. They ought to find an example about vain fear in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like unto ours, they can find none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expedient to make one. But although it were true, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> did refuſe to adore Jeſus Chriſt for fear that they ſhould adore a Man, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, they had been miſtaken, and we ſhall have reaſon to be unwilling to adore the Sacrament for fear of adoring Bread. For the Orthodox did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly prove to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that this Man was the Eternal Son of God, but the Papiſts will never prove that the Sacrament is the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Reformers have done nothing but renew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ended ſix hundred years ſince, when</hi> Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>moved them. And if you call in doubt the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was given againſt him, others with as much reaſon will doubt concerning preceding Councils, and behold us then obliged to examine anew all which hath been Decreed, as if we began to be Chriſtians, and that all that our Fathers have determined is good for nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not true that we have done nothing elſe but renew Controverſies ended ſix hundred years ago. We acknowledge no Authority in an Antichriſtian Church, ſuch was that in which <hi>Berengarius</hi> lived, to determine Controverſies. It hath no right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them, or at leaſt we have right to have no regard to her deciſions. It is preciſely that which our <hi>Arrians</hi> do now at this day ſay unto us, your Divines
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49990:30"/>and Schoolmen have done nothing elſe but renew Controverſies already determined more than twelve hundred years ago in the Councils of <hi>Tyre, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Millan,</hi> and <hi>Ariminum.</hi> The date is a little ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Authority in my opinion a little greater. For the Church of the <hi>Arrians</hi> was much more pure than that of the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been a great marvel if Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> had neglected to bring into this ſhort Letter the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms about the Judge of Controverſies. Theſe Gentlemen have nothing elſe to ſay, it is their only Rampart, it is neceſſary they always return thither. <hi>If it be permitted us to reject the Councils that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> Berengarius, <hi>behold us under a neceſſity to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine anew all the Councils which have decided the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies againſt the</hi> Arrians, Neſtorians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſignifies nothing, neither according to my Principles, nor thoſe of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux.</hi> Hath Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> forgotten that according to his Principles no Councils are infallible, but thoſe that are General? Wherefore then doth he demand the ſame ſubmiſſion for the Councils that condemned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> as for thoſe that condemned <hi>Arrius, Neſtorius,</hi> and <hi>Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</hi> Theſe laſt are conſidered as Oeconomical, and by conſequence as Infallible in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But a Council of <hi>Tours,</hi> of <hi>Verſeille,</hi> a Council of <hi>Rome,</hi> which have condemned <hi>Berengarius,</hi> were but particular Councils. Therefore they were not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible. Some of them had the Pope for their Head, yea, but according to Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> a great friend of the Theology of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the Pope is not Infallible, nor can he communicate it to any one. Let theſe Gentlemen fix their Principles, or let them not delude us by comparing Councils which can err, to Councils which according to them are Infallible, and cannot be miſtaken.</p>
            <p>If this be worth nothing according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49990:31"/>of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> it is worth leſs according to mine. Theſe Gentlemen will not take it amiſs if we have mote veneration for Councils held in the fourth Age, where they judged by the word of God, than for Councils of the eleventh Age, held in a time in which the Church was plunged into an abyſs of Corruption, according to the confeſſion of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and others like unto him. Therefore one may doubt of the truth of deciſions of the Councils of that Age, and not doubt of thoſe of all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Councils. But becauſe we are willing to have ſome ſubmiſſion for the deciſions of the Councils of the fourth Age, muſt we therefore pluck out our Eyes? Muſt we ceaſe to ſee that they did decide conformably to the Scripture? Muſt we ceaſe to build the ſubmiſſion, that we have for Councils, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the conformity of their deciſions with the Holy Scriptures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold us obliged to examine all anew as if we began to be Chriſtians.</hi> Behold us obliged to examine all anew, yea, every one for himſelf. And does not every one of us begin to be Chriſtian when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to live, and to make uſe of his reaſon. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is at agreement, that when a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be a Chriſtian he has right to examine. Societies, and Confederate Churches do not always begin to be Chriſtians, and therefore it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary that they examine. And when once they have formed their Confeſſions upon the word of God, it is not neceſſary that they repeat it, at leaſt unleſs it be made appear that they have erred, and be miſtaken. But every particular perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be a Chriſtian, he hath therefore right to examine. And ſo behold the right of ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons re eſtabliſhed by the reaſoning of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will not touch the reſt of the private Letter
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49990:31"/>of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> at this time, becauſe what he adds concerning the Judge of Controverſies, and the reflections which we have to make thereon, will fall in very well with what follows in his Paſtoral Letter, to which we ſhall return when we have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the examination of this. To fill up our ſheet we will give you a Letter of one of our moſt famous Confeſſors, which will begin to acquaint you with the Hiſtory of his Confeſſion. And afterwards you ſhall have ſome other Letters which have followed this.</p>

                  <p>IT is ſo advantageous, in tryals ſo barbarous, as that in which I have been, for ſix months laſt paſt, to be aſſiſted by your good Prayers, that it was my deſign, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur, to deſire them from the very moment of my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> But the difficulty which I find to get paſſage for my Letters out of the Kingdom, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of this benefit. Now when it ſeems, that I have more occaſion than before to procure for my ſelf this happy aſſiſtance, I do deſire it Monſieur with all earneſtneſs poſſible, and intreat you in the name of God not to refuſe me. The ſecond of <hi>December</hi> laſt, I with my Wife, and four Children, which God hath given me, were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted two Leagues on this ſide <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and conducted to a Priſon in that City, where we all were almoſt ſeven weeks. My Wife fearing to ſee our dear Family ruined fell under the temptation, and did what the Declaration of his Majeſty demanded of her. For my ſelf I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſupported my ſelf by the Grace of God, and have ſuffered all that, which Zeal hath been able to inſpire into the puiſſant Body of the Jeſuits, to make me fall, but God hath perfected his ſtrength in my weakneſs, and has given me the Grace boldly to maintain his Truth both with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49990:32"/>Heart and Mouth. From thence we were conducted by order of his Majeſty with a good guard to the Priſon of <hi>Challons,</hi> where I was juſt ſix weeks, fifteen days whereof I paſſed in a Dungeon, without being ſeen of any perſon, unleſs it were once or twice by my Wife. I was viſited by many Eccleſiaſticks, and amongſt others thrice by Monſieur Biſhop of <hi>Challons,</hi> of whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing but civilities. I was tempted by ſweetneſs, by many offers of ſervice, and in concluſion by ſeverity, and God by his Grace having rendered all the means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſeduce me ineffectual, the ninth of <hi>March</hi> laſt the Preſident condemned me to ſerve the King for ever in his Gallies, and my Goods to be Confiſcate as thoſe of a Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave. Two days after I was removed, and carried to <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was put in a dark Dungeon, and where I have been two whole months. After my arrival, I was twice preſent with the Procurator General in a Chamber of the Priſon. I anſwered to all that he ſaid to me, that which Jeſus Chriſt inſpired me withal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his holy promiſes. He viſited me alſo once after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and gave me this teſtimony, that it was rare to ſee me do that for error, which peradventure not one of them would do for truth. A little after Monſieur the firſt Preſident cauſed me to be taken out of the Dungeon, after the moſt civil manner in the World. When I was in the Chamber where he expected me, he cauſed all his retinue to go out, (which was made up of ſix or ſeven perſons of worth) and honoured me with his diſcourſe Face to Face for the ſpace of two hours, he teſtified a great deal of kindneſs towards me, and deſire to ſerve me, and as ſoon as he was gone out, he returned to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and told them, as one of my friends which was preſent reported to me, <hi>I come from diſcourſing an honeſt Man.</hi> Monſieur, theſe are but words, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there is ſomthing of conſolation in them. I have alſo received many marks of favour from Monſieur <hi>de Meſme,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>Tournel</hi> Chamber of Juſtice,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49990:32"/>where I was condemned, he talked with me at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Dungeon, and after a little diſcourſe told me, that it was with grief he ſaw me there, and that he wiſhed me ſome gentle ſickneſs, that he might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take me thence, and put me in the Hoſpital, and that as often as I deſired to ſpeak with him, I had no more to do than to tell the Goaler of it, who would give him knowledge thereof, and he would not fail to come to the Priſon, and ſee me. All theſe civilities had their deſign, but they were (thanks be to God) utterly ineffectual, God hath put into my Heart to be faithful to the death if there be occaſion for it. In concluſion, upon the ninth inſtant I was brought into the place of Judicature, and preſented to my Judges, they brought me to the Bar, and after I had taken my Oath, and they had drawn from me a confeſſion, whereof I glory, the Preſident after ſome diſcourſe of Religion ſaid to me, Monſieur, bethink your ſelf well, you know that the Declaration of the King doth expreſly determine your condemnation. I anſwered him, my Lord, I am paſt deliberations in this caſe, I am ready to ſuffer all thoſe penalties to which the Court ſhall pleaſe to condemn me, how rough ſoever they may be, they will be leſs troubleſom than to act againſt my Conſcience, and to play the part of an Hypocrite, who is an abhorrence to God, and Men. They appointed me to withdraw. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, contrary to the uſual method, I was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that morning, but the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, the fourteenth inſtant my condemnation was confirmed by a Decree of the Court, and about three hours after I was drawn out of the Dungeon; they put Irons on my Hands, they put me in a Coach, and I was carried to the <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> where they put the perſons condemned to the Gallies. The Governor here willing to treat me like an honeſt Man, put not the Chain but on my left foot, but on the morning the fifteenth inſtant, Monſieur the firſt Preſident, and the Procurator General told me, that they beheld my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with grief, and that the King intended they ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49990:33"/>put the Chain about my Neck, as is uſually done to thoſe that are the lewdeſt Villains. This news was ſoon brought to me, I told our Governor I ſhould obey the orders of the King with a very reſpectful ſubmiſſion. At the ſame time they took the Chain from my Foot, and put another about my Neck which weighed full fifty pound. Behold Monſieur the abridgment of my miſery, or to ſpeak more truly of my glory, for I give thanks every day to my God for the honour that he does me in not eſteeming me unworthy to ſuffer for his name. Join your prayers to mine I intreat you, Monſieur, to obtain from the Mercy of God his aſſiſtance ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my ſufferings. Let Mademoiſelle your Wife, if ſhe pleaſes grant me the ſuccour of her Prayers. Pardon the little order you will find in a Letter written by pieces, and by ſtealth, and in the midſt of twenty ſeven Gally-Slaves. I pray God to heap upon you both the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of his bleſſings.</p>

                  </gap>n the ſenſe of Scripture, do not acknowledge a living, ſpeaking Authority to which they do ſubmit, the Chriſtian Church is certainly the weakeſt of all Societies in the World, the moſt expoſed to remedileſs Diviſions, and moſt abandoned to factious Innovators. This is it to which your Miniſters with all their Subtleties have never been able to find an Anſwer.</hi> In truth 'tis to put great confidence in the Credulity of Men, to tell them with ſo much impudence, that the Miniſters have not been able to find an Anſwer to this Sophiſm. I do not think that there is any which hath been rejected with more force and more ſucceſs. And we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Nicholas</hi> to anſwer any thing that's reaſonable, to what hath been ſaid againſt the Infallibility of this pretended living, ſpeaking Judge, in the Anſwer which hath been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to the Book of M. <hi>— Nicholas,</hi> intituled, <hi>The pretended Reformed convinced of Schiſm.</hi> We have there anſwered it, and will anſwer it again. But this is no place to anſwer to it at large. We will content our ſelves to intreat you, my Brethren, to make two general Reflections thereon. Firſt, That Remedy can never be good, which never produces the effect, which Men ſay it doth always produce. M <hi>— de
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49990:34"/>Meaux</hi> pretends, that this certain, living, ſpeaking Authority is an infallible Remedy againſt Diviſions and Hereſies. <hi>For without it,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Church would be of all Societies moſt abandoned to Diviſions, Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Factions.</hi> If this Remedy be ſo good, why hath it never produced its effect? Was not <hi>this living, ſpeaking Authority</hi> in the world, was it not, ſay I, from the times of the Apoſtles, and the firſt Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? Why therefore have we ſeen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſwarms of Hereſies and Hereticks, <hi>Simonians, Corinthians, Baſilidians, Marcoſians, Valentinians, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites, Manicheans,</hi> and multitudes of others? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the fourth and fifth Ages of the Church was it torn in pieces by <hi>Arrians, Neſtorians, Eutychians, Photinians?</hi> Why do they account to the number of two or three hundred Hereſies? Why did this brave Remedy againſt Diviſions permit the Schiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> more than three hundred years? That of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> more than twelve hundred? That of the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> as long? Why doth not this excellent Remedy put an end to the Schiſm of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the duration of near eight hundred years? Was it this living, ſpeaking Authority which ſuppreſſed the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> or the Fire and Sword of <hi>Simon de Montfort,</hi> and his Villains? Why hath this <hi>living, and ſpeaking Authority</hi> permitted the <hi>Latin</hi> Church to be torn in pieces in theſe latter Ages? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, in truth, a fine Remedy good for nothing, and which over and above is eſtabliſhed upon inconſiſtent Principles, as hath been proved an hundred times.</p>
            <p>The other general Reflection which I deſire you would make, is on the great inconvenience that Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> finds in acknowledging, <hi>That the Church is the weakeſt of all Societies in the World.</hi> I do profeſs, that it appears very uneaſie to me, as well as to him, and I am not without all inclination to reaſon with him, and ſay, There is no appearance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49990:35"/>or probability that the Church ſhould be the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent of all Societies under the Heavens, and by conſequence 'tis not likely that it ſhould have been the Tennis Ball of Perſecutors, of Tyrants, of malignant Spirits, of Schiſmaticks, of Hereticks, of factious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators, and vitious corrupters of the Truth, and Worſhip of God. And ſo all that hath been ſaid of Perſecutions, Puniſhments, Hereſies, Seditions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the Church, Strife among Biſhops, their Quarrels and Diviſions, of the fury of Schiſms, of the horrible corruption of Manners that hath been ſeen in ſome Ages, and is ſeen in this, all theſe things, ſay I, are falſe. For 'tis impoſſible, that the Church ſhould be the weakeſt of all Societies, which it would be, if what hath been ſaid, yea, and what our eyes ſee, be true. So that it muſt needs be that all Hiſtories be Romances, and all Objects that we ſee Illuſions, and that there be a Wall of Fire about the Church that hinders all ſorts of Evils from approaching it. 'Tis a Prodigy in my apprehenſion, that Men ſhould be found that will deſtroy truths in matter of fact, ſenſe and experience by Diſcourſes in the air. Theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen do never enter into the depths of God's ways, they do not perceive nor underſtand, that 'tis indeed by the order of his Providence, that to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſenſe the Church is the moſt feeble of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, moſt given up to the will and luſt of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Men of Faction and Innovation. Where is the Society that hath been given up, and expoſed to ſo many Schiſms, Diviſions and Perſecutions as the Church? But the Power of God, and the Stability of the Church conſiſts in this, that it ſubſiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to all Aſſaults, and that God preſerves in the midſt of thoſe Schiſms and Diviſions, Errors and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, thoſe fundamental Truths, and Precepts of Morality, by which the Elect are preſerved, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the general corruption that doth involve,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49990:35"/>and overwhelm it. Herein is the ſtrength of the Church, and 'tis a Miracle, and on the occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ought to ſay, 'Tis the Finger of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without putting you upon Inquiries, and Diſquiſitions, conſider whether it be likely, that God who hath permitted ſo many depths in the Scriptures, and that from thence have arrived ſo many Schiſms among thoſe that profeſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and believe them, hath not left ſome means in his Church to quiet and determine them. Is it likely, that there ſhould be no remedy for Diviſions, but that every one may believe according to his own fancy, and the minds of Men be thence led inſenſibly to an indifference in Religions, which is the greateſt of all Evils?</hi> Is not this what I ſaid but even now? To diſcourſe in the air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt known matters of Fact, and againſt ſuch Truths as all the World confeſs and avow! Let us ſay with Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> it is not probable that God ſhould leave ſo many depths in the Holy Scriptures, from which ſo many Diviſions might ariſe, and not leave to his Church ſome means to put a period to them. Behold the Principle. And who can deny ſo plauſible a Maxim? But behold my Concluſion. Therefore there have been never any Diviſions about the ſenſe of Scripture, which the Church hath not found means to determine. Therefore it hath well and eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the Diviſions which continued well nigh the ſpace of four hundred years about the Senſe of thoſe Words, <hi>The Father is greater than I.</hi> Therefore it quieted the Difference about the Senſe of thoſe other Words, <hi>The word was made fleſh.</hi> And 'tis not true, that there are millions of Chriſtians in the Eaſt, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians</hi> that have not agreed with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about the meaning of them for 1200 years paſſed. Therefore it hath raiſed the Diviſions about the Senſe of thoſe Words of Jeſus Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter, Feed my Sheep.</hi> And it is not true-that all the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is at a Schiſm with the <hi>Latin</hi> Church
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49990:36"/>thereon, and are not of the mind that they mean that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to be univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor of all Churches. They ſay, and 'tis believed, that the <hi>Latin</hi> Church hath been divided almoſt two hundred years, about the Senſe of thoſe Words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> The <hi>Lutherans</hi> give one ſenſe, the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> another, and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> a third ſenſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. But that is not true, 'tis a popular Error, and an illuſion. It is not probable, that God ſhould not leave any means to his Church to quiet the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that ſhould ariſe about the Senſe of Scripture. A Man would think theſe Gentlemen had a deſign to ſcoff and deride Mankind; they form an <hi>Eutopia,</hi> a world made at pleaſure, out of their own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tell us, that the preſent world is ſo made, and that we are in it, and very well and ſafe there. 'Tis in vain that we deny it, and ſay 'tis not ſo, we ſee the contrary, the world is not made as you report it. They anſwer us, you deceive your ſelves, you are blind Buzzards, and ſee nothing; you ſeem indeed to ſee the contrary, but nevertheleſs it can be no otherwiſe than we ſay, and we will demonſtrate it by reaſon. My Brethren, you may there perceive the falſeneſs and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the method of your Converters. Learn from hence in three words what is the proper method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing them, have recourſe to experience, and tell them you will prove, that it ought to be ſo, and I ſee with my eyes the contrary to what you ſay ought to be.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore true, that God hath given a ſure and eaſie means to quiet the Differences, which may ariſe about the Senſe of Scripture. God will ſave his ſelect, but he will abandon his Enemies to blindneſs.</p>
            <p>Tis his pleaſure, that there be Difficulties in the way of Faith and Salvation, but he hath filled the Holy Scriptures with Light to diſſipate theſe Darkneſſes with reſpect to his Elect. And as for the Reprobates, he permit, this ſpiritual darkneſs, which hinders them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49990:36"/>from ſeeing the ſparkling and lightſome Truths, which are in the Scripture, to remain upon their Hearts. God hath not left certain means to prevent and pacifie Diviſions, we are convinced of that by experience. For Diviſions do continue among Chriſtians, and have done ſo for fifteen Centuries, what means ſoever have been uſed to heal them. But he hath left means ſufficiently certain for the conduct of his Children to eternal Life, by the way and path of Truth. 'Tis his Holy Word, together with the direction of his Spirit, which conducts infallibly, not whole Societies, but all that are his in particular, in all the Truths, that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and preſerves them from all thoſe Errors, that are mortal to their Souls. <hi>Think, think of that, Mr. hearken to your own reaſon, and not to the ſubtleties of your Miniſters.</hi> Think, think of that my Brethren: conſult both your reaſon and your ſenſe, attend to that which your eyes report, and don't hearken to the vain reaſonings of Men, who diſcourſe not upon that which is, but upon that which ought to be according to their imaginations. Behold, that which we have to ſay at preſent about this important matter, which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> touches in his private Letter, We muſt now return to his Paſtoral Letter, and ſee how he proves the Title of his ſecond Article.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article has for its Title in the Margin, <hi>That the Paſtors of the Catholick Church are the only true Paſtors.</hi> He proves it by two Mediums. The firſt is, That the Paſtors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> alone have the advantage of mutual ſucceſſion in place and feat one to another. <hi>Monſieur</hi> de Meaux <hi>maintains that he is in the place af thoſe that planted the Goſpel in hit Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</hi> And all other Biſhops, he ſays, have the ſame Glory. The ſecond proof is, that they have alſo a ſucceſſion of Doctrine. 'Tis well when theſe two things go together, for otherwiſe to glory of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49990:37"/>of Seats, without a Succeſſion of Doctrine is, in my opinion, the moſt pitiful glory that any one can aſcribe to himſelf. The Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who, according to Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> is a Schiſmatick, he and all his Predeceſſors for above 800 years, is alſo in the place of thoſe who planted the Goſpel in thoſe Countries. Nevertheleſs the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized him an 100 times, and doth anathematize him every year on Good Friday, in the Bull <hi>De Coena Domini.</hi> The <hi>Arrian</hi> Biſhops did hold the place of the Apoſtles in the Eaſt; and at this day the Biſhops of <hi>Denmark, Sueden</hi> and <hi>England</hi> are alſo in the place of them which planted Chriſtianity in thoſe Countries.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> perceives well, that the Glory of Succeſſion can do him no great good without Doctrine, and therefore does very fairly renounce it. <hi>To ſeparate ſound Doctrine from the Chair of Succeſſion, is to ſeparate a ſtream from the Channel,</hi> ſays he. 'Tis true, the Channel remains in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we agree with them in that, from the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to the laſt we ſee no conſiderable interruption; either Hiſtory is not to be credited, or Biſhops have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one to another. Behold the Channel mark'd and noted. But by misfortune they have ſeparated the River from the Channel, and in this Succeſſion of Biſhops there has ſucceeded a dirty and impoiſoned River, to pure water, and to a clean and clear Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is very happy therefore in his compariſon in this ſmall Paragraph, but he is not ſo altogethet in that which follows, <hi>And to vaunt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>themſelves of the underſtanding of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when they acknowledge they have loſt the ſtream of Tradition in their Paſtors, is to vaunt of having preſerved the Waters after the Pipes are broken.</hi> Surely, if the Waters were no where but in the Channel, Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> and his Brethren had ſome reaſon on their ſide, but 'tis happy for us, and miſchievous to them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49990:37"/>that the Water is in the Fountain before it can be in the Channel. The Channels may be broken, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Succeſſors of Seats may become Antichriſtian. The Fountain of the Goſpel-Doctrine continues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pure in the Holy Scripture. It had been very fine, if they had reaſon'd ſo at the time when Jeſus Chriſt came into the World. The Phariſees and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Law were in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Chair, and, as ſuch, Jeſus Chriſt commanded to hear them; but according to the new Philoſophy of our Doctors, our Lord ſhould have done otherwiſe: for inſtead of thundering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vain Ceremonies and falſe Gloſſes of theſe Doctors which corrupted the Law, he ought to have followed them, and cauſed his Diſciples to do ſo to. For to <hi>boaſt of underſtanding the Scripture, when they acknowledge they have loſt the ſtream of Tradition in their Paſtors; is to vaunt of having preſerved the Waters after the Pipes are broken.</hi> The Pipes, that is, the Doctors were broken, but did not the purity of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as in his Fountain? Let that be remembred therefore, and never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. The Goſpel-Church in this regard is in no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition than the ancient Synagogue. This had its Phariſees and falſe Prieſts in the Chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that hath its falſe Biſhops in the Chair of the Apoſtles, and Founders of Chriſtianity. Let it be remembred alſo, that when the Pipes are broken, and the Rivers corrupt, we have the Fountain. Jeſus Chriſt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thither: he ſaid, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo.</hi> Frankly therefore 'tis to delude, and ridiculouſly to delude when they ſpeak of a Succeſſion of Chairs, at leaſt, unleſs it be proved, that Truth hath remained in them, and that Infallibility hath always been placed there, and that in matters of Doctrine there have been made no Innovation. And thither Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> comes at laſt. The Doctrine and underſtanding of Scriptures, ſays he, is come even to him, without any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49990:38"/>change or alteration. <hi>And it has been the pleaſure of God that it ſhould come to us from Paſtor to Paſtor, and from hand to hand without any appearance of Innovation.</hi> This is eaſily ſaid, but I do not underſtand, how perſons that write in an Age ſo knowing, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, as ours is, ſhould have the impudence to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch a thing, that ſince S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> the Doctrine is come down without any Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. My Brethren, 'tis an important point, 'tis an Article about which they do miſerably blind you, 'tis a voice that founds perpetually in your ears, and does almoſt make you deaf. Antiquity, Tradition, conſtant Succeſſion and Perpetuity of Faith; and how do they prove it to you? They tell you the Church is infallible, therefore it can't err, nor turn aſide from ſound Doctrine. Secondly, Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells you, <hi>If there had been ſuch changes among us, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof would have been named, the Spirit of Truth which is in the Church would have noted them, and their Names would have been infamous, as that of the</hi> Arrians <hi>and</hi> Neſtorians, &amp;c. <hi>So that all which has been told us concerning inſenſible changes in Doctrine, whereof they do not produce any example in the Chriſtian Church, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a vain accuſation.</hi> Thirdly, To conclude, they take up certain Shreds of the Fathers, which they ſet to be ſeen with Gloſſes and in a falſe light, and afterwards tell you boldly, behold the Conformity of the Fathers with us, behold the Succeſſion of the ſame Opinions in the ſame Seats. There has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened no change or alteration.</p>
            <p>This, ſay I, deſerves that we ſtay on it a little, for 'tis the fountain of Illuſions, by which they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and made ſome new Converts. Concerning the firſt of theſe three Proofs, which is drawn from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, we hope at ſome time to ſhew you the abſurdity of that pretenſion. We will prove, that all that which M. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and M. <hi>Peliſſon</hi> have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49990:38"/>advanced to prove the neceſſity of this infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, without which, according to them, truth cannot be found, is a Contexture of Fallacies, which lead Men directly to impiety. But in expectation thereof (my dear Brethren) we intreat you to give attention to what we are about to ſay concerning this ſovereign and infallible Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I will give you two general methods, by which, without any great difficulty, you may be able to quit your ſelves of the Fallacies of your Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Firſt tell me, is there any reaſon can hold good againſt experience? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can't err, I'll prove it, ſay they, by juſt proofs and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the Church can't be left without a Guide, becauſe private and particular perſons can't underſtand the Scriptures, becauſe there is a neceſſity, that an Interpreter which ought to guide others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not himſelf be deceived. Behold, that which is the moſt ſtately and magnificent reaſoning in the world. But by blowing upon theſe pompous Reaſons of Right, I will make them vaniſh by one ſole Proof and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Fact. 'Tis that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath erred an hundred times by introducing Images into Churches, and eſtabliſhing the Invocation of Saints, in taking the Cup from the Laity, and in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Sacrament to be adored, &amp;c. Call to mind, my Brethren, the Man, to whom the Philoſopher proved by ſubtleties, which he could not anſwer, that there was no ſuch thing as motion. After having long labored under the weight of his Fallacies, he roſe up briskly, and walkd about the Room. You find your ſelves often perplexed with the Sophiſms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to ſupport the ways of Preſcription, and to prove the blind ſubmiſſion which ought to be had for the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I do not doubt but you are oftentimes in ſome perplexity in this reſpect. But go briskly out of that perplexity, and always come to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49990:39"/>this. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath erred, therefore it can err. You will put your Converters, in their turn, into ſome kind of perplexity. For there will be a neceſſity either that they hold their peace, and ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but abſurdities, or elſe that they endeavour to prove by diſcuſſion of Opinions, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has not erred, and 'tis a Head of Diſcourſe where I am in no fear or concern for you; for how little ſoever you are inſtructed in the Word of God, you will eaſily diſmount the moſt able Sophiſters, when you endeavour to prove, that neither Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, nor the Worſhip of Images, nor the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, nor the Adoration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, nor the Maſs, nor Purgatory, are in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. There needs no greater ability for that, than for a Man to prove that a Chamber is empty when there is nothing in it. They object unto you, that the Scripture has not ſaid all, but 'tis a ſenſible abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, that the Scripture ſhould be given to inſtruct us concerning what we ought to adore, and it ſhould forget three fourth parts of the objects of our Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It ſpeaks not to us but of the Adoration of God; and nevertheleſs Religious Worſhip muſt be given to Saints, to Images, to Reliques, and to the Sacrament of the Altar. Are you ſo filly as to be taken in ſo pitiful a ſnare? The Scripture has not ſaid all, let it be granted with reſpect to the Ceremonies and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Diſcipline, which are not of the Eſſence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but to believe that the Scripture has not told us all which is of the Eſſence of the Chriſtian Religion, is ridiculous: I do maintain, that he ought to have loſt all ſhame, that ſhall advance it, and to permit himſelf to be perſuaded thereof, he muſt have loſt all reaſon, and be degenerated to a Beaſt. Was it agreeable to the Wiſdom of God, imperfectly to inſtruct the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Church, and to leave to poſterity the charge of adding thoſe eſſential parts which were wanting? But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49990:39"/>provided you can draw your Converters from theſe Methods of Preſcription, which are the true Snares of the Devil, invented as his laſt Remedies, I ſhall not fear, or be concerned for you, altho they ſhould bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you with the Arms of Tradition, and tho they ſhould tell you an hundred times the Scripture has not ſaid all, Tradition adds the reſt. For you will always have an infallible Refuge in the Scripture, and you will be able to ſay, if Tradition may add to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, at leaſt, it ought not to deſtroy, and teach or command that which the Scripture condemns. After which it will not be difficult to prove, that not only the Scripture ſays nothing of Tranſubſtantiation, or the taking away of the Cup, or the Sacrifice of the Maſs, of Purgatory, or the Worſhip of Images, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that the Scripture does formally condemn them. Behold the firſt general method for ruining the fallacious Arguments on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Infallibility.</p>
            <p>Behold another, the moſt ſenſible proof, (and that unto which you will be obliged to have regard, when they would prove that you ought to have a blind ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) is Texts of Scripture. 'Tis for example, that which our Lord Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>That he hath built his Church upon S.</hi> Peter, <hi>in ſuch ſort, that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</hi> That which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That the Church is the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> There's that which is their ſtrength. But firſt of all demand of theſe Gentlemen, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be mentioned there? Say, I grant, that Text ſignifies, that the Church is infallible, and that the Devil never can introduce any Error; but how ſhall I know that 'tis the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to whom this glorious promiſe of Infallibility is made? The <hi>Greek</hi> Church, that of the <hi>Neſtorians, Jacobites,</hi> or <hi>Eutychians,</hi> are very great Communions in the Eaſt, which call themſelves
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49990:40"/>Chriſtians upon as good a Title as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Apoſtles certainly founded the Eaſtern Churches, it is without peradventure, and it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that Jeſus Chriſt hath left the privilege of being infallible to them. Why ſhould he cauſe it to paſs from the Eaſt to the Weſt? To that they will ſay, you ſee that 'tis to the Church of S. <hi>Peter</hi> that the promiſe of Infallibility is made: <hi>Upon thee will I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Now the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Upon that, demand that they prove by the Scripture theſe two Articles: Firſt, That this promiſe was not made but to the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> is the Founder of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The firſt thing is impoſſible to be proved. 'Tis a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious abſurdity, that of the twelve Apoſtles to whom Chriſt Jeſus ſaid, that they ought to found Churches, he ſhould have no regard but to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the Church which he ought to found. 'Tis more clear than the day, that that which our Lord promiſed, he promiſed to the twelve Apoſtles and to other Churches. But your Converters will have yet more trouble to prove by the Scripture, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> There appears not any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep thereof in the whole New Teſtament: on the contrary 'tis clear, there was a Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> before S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been there. It may be, one may prove, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was never at <hi>Rome.</hi> At leaſt it may be proved, that he never reſided there in the Quality of Biſhop. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays expreſly, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apoſtle or Biſhop of the Jews, or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; and that he was the Biſhop of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Therefore S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in the Quality of the Biſhop of the converted Jews, ought to have his Seat either at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the Confines whereof was the main body of the diſperſed Jews. Moreover he writ and dated his Epiſtles from <hi>Babylon.</hi> You may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49990:40"/>therefore hold your ſelves there, and ſay, I am well content that there be an infallible Church on earth; but when I ſee with all my eyes, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church has erred, you ſhall permit me to ſearch an infallible Church elſewhere, and to keep me where I am expecting till I ſind it.</p>
            <p>You may, I ſay, keep you there, but don't do it; move on further, and tell your Converters, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I perceive, that theſe words, <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt the Church,</hi> may have two ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. For they may ſignifie, that the Devil ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver introduce any error into the Church, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever it be. Or it may ſignifie, that the Devil ſhall never ruin the Church, that he ſhall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtroy it by ruining its Foundations, <hi>i. e.</hi> its fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Verities. Tell me, do theſe words ſignifie neceſſarily the firſt, that is to ſay, that the Devil ſhall never introduce any capital or conſiderable Errors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, or to ſpeak better, that the Church ſhall never fall into any Error? Not at all: For if one ſay to a Prince, I will take care that your Enemies ſhall never prevail upon you, that will not neceſſarily ſignifie, that the Enemy ſhall never have any Victory upon him, or gain any conſiderable advantage againſt him. Altho this Prince ſhould loſe ſome Villages, yea, and ſome Provinces, yet if the groſs and capital parts of his Empire always ſubſiſt notwithſtanding, he would have the accompliſhment of the promiſe made unto him. Provided therefore, that the Church ſubſiſt in all Ages, altho corrupt, provided that the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity remain throughout in their integrity, the promiſe, <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> hath its accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>But your Converters will tell you, theſe words ſignifie not ſo; for they ſignifie that the Church can never fall into any Error. Anſwer them, That is the thing that is in queſtion between you and me. But who
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49990:41"/>ſhall judge for us, concerning the ſenſe of theſe words? It muſt not be you, for you are a party; and who can better judge than Scripture, and Experience? Now 'tis clear by the Scripture, that the ſenſe of theſe words, <hi>the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt the Church,</hi> is not that the Church ſhall never ſuffer any conſiderable Errors in its Faith. All the Holy Scripture affirms the contrary. It complains ſometimes that the ancient Church was become idolatrous, and had ſerved other gods. It foretels in expreſs words, that the Chriſtian Church ſhould corrupt it ſelf: <hi>That grievous wolves ſhould enter into the fold not ſparing the flock. That there would be perilous times in which there would be an Apoſtacy from the Faith, and ſeducing Spirits would teach Doctrines of Devils. That Antichriſt the ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhould ſit in the Temple, and in the Church of God. That the Church ſhould be hid, and as in a deſart for the ſpace of one thouſand two hundred and ſixty prophetick days, that is one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years. That when the Son of Man ſhall come he ſhall not find faith, nor love among Men. That falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts ſhall ariſe, and deceive many.</hi> To conclude, for one Text by which it may be proved that the Church cannot err, we can produce an hundred that do affirm, that falſe Teachers ſhould introduce Errors there-into.</p>
            <p>Let us leave the Scriptures, and paſs to Experience, and ſee whether the Church hath not actually erred. It is proved clearly that ſhe hath erred, becauſe ſhe hath eſtabliſhed a Worſhip directly oppoſite to that pure, and ſimple Worſhip, the Model whereof is found in the New Teſtament, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Images, of Saints, and Sainteſſes, of a ſecond ſort of Mediators, of Maſſes, Sacrifices, and a hundred other things, that have not the leaſt ſhadow of appointment there. Let us return to our Text, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt the Church.</hi> It is diſputed whether this
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49990:41"/>Text doth ſignifie that the Church can never Err in any wiſe, or whether it ſignifies that the foundations and fundamental verities of the Church can never be overturned. In truth, the laſt ſenſe is that of Jeſus Chriſt. And all that can be granted to the Papiſts, is that they are capable of the other. But is it not very clear that we ought to chuſe the latter, ſeeing the Holy Scripture and experience determines us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by a manner wholly invincible? It is true, and we ſee it, that by a ſingular Providence, God hath not permitted the Foundations of Chriſtianity to be ſubverted in any of the Chriſtian Communions, all receive the Creeds of the Apoſtles, <hi>Nice, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> yea even that attributed to St. <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Behold therefore what our Lord would mean thereby. But beſides this we ſee that there is no Communion that hath continued pure, all have embraced Errors, and ſome of them ſuch as are filthy, ſhameful, and mortal. Therefore it is not that which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt would ſay, it is not a promiſe of abſolute infallibility that is made to the Chriſtian Church. Without doubt he foretold what is come to paſs, and not that which never happened. Behold, my Brethren, two general methods by which you may be able to reſcue your ſelves from the Sophiſms, and fallacious Arguments, which they call ways of Preſcription, till we can clear up thoſe difficulties that you your ſelves cannot reſolve, about that ſubmiſſion that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to have for their Guides, to the end that they may walk ſafely.</p>
            <p>The ſecond medium, or argument, wherewith all theſe Gentlemen ſerve themſelves, and whereof Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſerves himſelf here to prove that they have a ſucceſſion of Doctrine, as well as a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Seats, is the impoſſibility of inſenſible changes. If the Invocation of Saints, ſay they, the worſhip of Images, Maſſes without Communicants,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49990:42"/>the taking away of the Cup had been newly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the Innovator would have been known, and his name would have been branded with infamy, as that of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius.</hi> I do not think that ever any thing hath been done more oppoſite to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fidelity, than the diſputes theſe Gentlemen have thought fit to raiſe againſt inſenſible changes and alterations. I ſay firſt it is oppoſite to fidelity: For it is not poſſible that theſe Gentlemen can believe what they ſay, when they tell us, that we cannot determine the Authors, nor the times of the principal Changes whereof we complain, ſeeing on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we obſerve to them the times, the principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and the noiſe that theſe Innovations made in the World. Does not every one know, that the introduction of Images into the Church, the taking away of the Cup, and the eſtabliſhment of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority did make a terrible noiſe, ſuffer great contraditions, cauſe great troubles, and even the ſhedding of much blood in the Church? It is therefore notoriouſly to diſpute againſt honeſty, and fidelity, to deny that we are able to give any account of the moſt eminent, and principal Innovations.</p>
            <p>But is it not to diſpute againſt reaſon, and ſound judgment, to ſay as Monſieur de <hi>Meaux</hi> doth, that if there had been any Innovators in the Church, the ſpirit of Truth would have marked them, and their names would have been infamous, as thoſe of <hi>Arrius, Neſtorius,</hi> &amp;c. How could the names of theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators be infamous, ſeeing their Innovations were received, and entertained. The Authors of Hereſies, and Superſtitions which are rejected, are indeed noted with infamy, but thoſe that are received are Canonized, and adored. Therefore thoſe of the fourth Age, which introduced the Invocation of Saints had no note of infamy put upon them, becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of that unhappy Superſtition were greedily
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49990:42"/>imbraced. The reaſon why thoſe things, in thoſe Ages, were not treated as Innovations, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them as Innovators, was becauſe they adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and received them. Had they aſſigned any note of infamy upon them, they had condemned the worſhip which they admitted, they had accuſed it of Novelty, and by conſequence the Authors thereof of boldneſs, and temerity, ſeeing it is an opinion that hath always prevailed, that it is a Criminal enterpriſe to Innovate in Religion. And ſo the Superſtitions of the fifth Age were well content to ſuffer poſterity to believe that the Invocation of Saints, and the Adoration of Relicks were more ancient than the preceding Age.</p>
            <p>To conclude, about inſenſible changes, whereof the poſſibility is denied, I beſeech you my Brethren, obſerve the ſpirit and temper of your Converters, and tell me what name ought to be given to them. We prove to them the changes that are happened in the Church by proofs more clear, and evident than the light of the Sun. For example we ſhew them that in ſuch an Age, there was no Invocation of Saints or Angels. We ſhew it them, I ſay, not only by negative proofs, as we uſe to ſpeak, that is to ſay, by the ſilence of the Writers of ſuch an Age, but by poſitive proofs, and becauſe the opinions of the Writers, and the practice of the Church then were wholly oppoſite thereunto. Afterwards we ſhew them the firſt beginnings, the original, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Error, Superſtition, and Idolatry. In one Age we ſee plainly that ſuch worſhip was not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, in the Age following it is as plain that it was practiſed. I do maintain that a Man muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all ſhame to ſay as theſe Gentlemen, that from ſuch an Age to the following there was no change, and the foundation of this impudence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no ſingle perſon is found, whoſe name is known,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49990:43"/>that did ariſe, and laboured to introduce ſuch, or ſuch an Error, or Superſtition, which met with great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but at length ſurmounted them all. They that pleaſe to make uſe of their underſtandings, and conſult with Hiſtory, may find that this affirmation hath no truth, nor place but in changes that happen at a puſh, and all together, the Novelty whereof doth affright, and ſtir up oppoſition; but in Cuſtoms, and Opinions that prevail gradually, and by little and little, it is not ſo. The Invocation of Saints, and the Worſhip of Images were not eſtabliſhed by one ſingle perſon, nor at one ſingle heat. A whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by a falſe Devotion, permitted themſelves inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to fall into certain practices, that ſeemed very Innocent, and it may be they were not very Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. They which came after thruſt forward this Superſtition, and in fine it came to Idolatry. I will ſay yet once more, I know not how a Mans mind and ſpirit muſt be made to ſay that ſuch manner of changes are impoſſible. Theſe Gentlemen cannot deny that the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, is very much different from that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Church. Take it for granted, my Brethren, that there is no <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Doctor, who will not acknowledge that the Liturgy of the Maſs at this day is more compounded, and leſs ſimple than it was in the days of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Were theſe additions made in a ſenſible manner? Were not theſe changes intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by little and little? The more ſincere of theſe Gentlemen, as Monſieur <hi>Baluzius,</hi> and the Author of the Dialogues againſt the Iconoclaſts of the S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> do acknowledge that in the firſt three Ages of the Church there were no Images; and we do affirm that in the fifth and ſixth Age there were many. We cannot name the firſt Author of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and of the introduction of Images into Churches. Will Monſieur <hi>Baluzius</hi> therefore affirm
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49990:43"/>that from the time of the Apoſtles there were Images in Churches?</p>
            <p>But What? It is to ſmall purpoſe to ſpeak; theſe Gentlemen perſevere to maintain that no change hath been made in the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church, and that none can be made: and we do maintain it can be made, becauſe it hath been made. We have preciſely the ſame thing to ſay which we ſaid concerning the infallibility of the Church: the Papiſts ſay it hath not erred, for it is infallible, and we ſay it is not infallible, for it hath erred. Alſo, they ſay there has been no change made in the Doctrine of the Church, for it was impoſſible any ſhould be made there; and we ſay it is very poſſible changes ſhould happen there, for ſo it is come to paſs. Who is it that reaſons beſt? That depends only on the queſtion in matter of Fact. We muſt ſee whether changes have actually happened in the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church. Now it is my deſign to make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that changes have arrived there; this is neceſſary for the diſſipation of an unhappy illuſion wherewith they ſerve themſelves to blind you. It is Antiquity, Tradition, Conformity with the Religion of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertake to give you a ſhort Hiſtory of the changes which have happened in the Church, at leaſt for the firſt five Ages thereof. It is the ſureſt method to ſhew you how falſe the impoſſibility of inſenſible changes is, and this will be the ſureſt remedy to leſſen the charm of falſe Antiquity, by which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deceive you. This ſhall be the matter of our following Letters, where we will ſet before your Eyes the State of Chriſtianity, and the changes which are arrived there during the ſpace of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
            <p>☜ To finiſh this Letter, my dear Brethren, I will ſet before your Eyes an example which ought
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49990:44"/>to ſhame the moſt of you. If you confeſs God, it is in ſecret, if you ſigh it is in your own Boſom: the moſt part of you dare not give any publick mark, though never ſo little bright and ſhining of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, that are in the bottom of your Soul. Learn the Conduct of our poor Brethren the Inhabitants of <hi>Cevennes.</hi> The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was made void the year paſt, on the month of <hi>October:</hi> the Paſtors were chaſed away, and all exerciſe of Religion forbidden upon great penalties expreſſed by the Declaration. But theſe Inhabitants of the Mountains began their private Aſſemblies from the month of <hi>November</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. And God raiſed up from among them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that without Study, and without Learning, put themſelves at the head of theſe Aſſemblies for their Edification. I will not tell your their names, leſt I ſhould put them in hazard and danger.</p>
            <p>There was a private perſon of the place called <hi>V.—</hi> to whoſe word God gave ſo much efficacy, that after ſome Aſſemblies where there were but a few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, one night he had the pleaſure of comforting many hundreds. And theſe Aſſemblies continuing almoſt every day, one day a little before night, there were found more than eight hundred perſons upon the Mountain of <hi>Brion</hi> near to <hi>Caderles.</hi> They had there the conſolation of hearing two excellent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and one Sermon: after all, thoſe that had the courage to reſiſt temptation, did partake in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Many of thoſe which had fallen, with a great many fears, deſired the Communion; among others a Woman of Quality was very deſirous thereof weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and profeſſing that ſhe would never go to Maſs; but it was refuſed her, until they ſhould receive greater marks of the ſincerity of her return and repentance. A few days after there was another Aſſembly in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, under the covert of a Barn, in the Pariſh of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49990:44"/>St. <hi>Martin de Carcones,</hi> where there were full out ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred perſons. It was in the night, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until two hours before day. Two days after there was another Aſſembly in the Pariſh of St. <hi>John de Gardoningue,</hi> where there were ſeven or eight hundred perſons. The day after, on the Lords day, in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Croſs de Caderles,</hi> there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where there were about fourteen hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all the Neighbouring Villages. They had knowledge of this Aſſembly. The Intendant and Judges ſent an Advocate named <hi>Joly,</hi> to inform them concerning it; all their diligence went no further than to diſcover three or four perſons, there was ſo much fidelity among thoſe that made up theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. They took one which they threatned with death, he ſeemed to comply, and promiſed to tell what he knew. But whether indeed he knew no body, or was not willing to name them, he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at firſt but two perſons. Nevertheleſs thoſe of the Village of St. <hi>John,</hi> who believed that they had been all diſcovered by the perſons that had been taken, fled and ſaved themſelves in the Woods. This flight diſcovered them, and the way with which they ſerve themſelves to force confeſſions, learnt the Perſecutors almoſt all thoſe which had aſſiſted at theſe Aſſemblies. But they found the number of them ſo great, that it forced them, and alſo conſtrained them to ceaſe theſe Perſecutions, ſeeing that they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate the Country if they proceeded rigorouſly againſt the accuſed. They therefore reſolved to ſend them back upon promiſe that they would return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no more, reſerving nevertheleſs liberty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of chaſtiſing thoſe which they called Heads of theſe undertakings.</p>
            <p>Theſe threatnings and theſe Perſecutions could not oblige the faithful to give over, and a few days after, without more delay, they had another Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49990:45"/>in a Meadow in the ſame Pariſh of St. <hi>John,</hi> where there were near two thouſand perſons. There was Prayer, Preaching, and the Communion. As they were in the middle of this exerciſe, a voice was heard to ſay that the Dragoons drew near, upon which, he that performed the Office of a Paſtor, cryed out <hi>La</hi> thoſe that fear depart; but not one perſon ſtirred, every one prepared himſelf to ſuffer Martyrdom. The Dragoons came not on the place until the day after. They ſaw the Graſs trodden, and thereupon the Prieſt which accompanied them, ſaid that the Devil had kept his Sabbath there the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They made Priſoners ſome of the Peaſants of the neighbouring Villages, and carried them to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> where they took their Depoſitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed them. Theſe methods of proceeding were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to affrighten them, but they prevailed nothing, for the <hi>Monday</hi> following there was another Meeting, or Aſſembly of two thouſand perſons in another place of the ſame Pariſh. An unhappy Apoſtate of the Town of <hi>Caderles,</hi> named <hi>Mazel,</hi> went and accuſed, and diſcovered them to the Curate of the Village of St. <hi>John,</hi> who went thither the day after with ſome Officers of Juſtice, that he might repair to <hi>Bebe,</hi> which was the place where the Aſſembly was held, they muſt paſs over Precipices, and Rocks, which made them think it was impoſſible, that they ſhould paſs that way by night, and the Curate ſaid in a Language common enough with thoſe honeſt Men: I do not know how theſe Devils could paſs here in the night.</p>
            <p>I would, my Brethren, that you ſhould compare your tenderneſs with this unwearied Zeal. This is nothing to what you will ſee afterward, but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs enough to ſhew you, that God hath choſen the weak things of the World to confound the ſtrong. Theſe poor Inhabitants of the Mountains, with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49990:45"/>their ignorance, and ruſticity, will riſe up in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agaieſt you. We hear that you run in troops to the Popiſh Churches, to hear their Sermons. It is not there that you ought to ſeek the word of God. You will not find it there, but corrupt, and mingled with human Traditions, and although ſome Preachers ſhould affect, and chuſe to Preach nothing but Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unto you, nevertheleſs there will be danger in going to hear them. But we intend to diſcourſe you more at large on this ſubject, till when we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Grace of God.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WE will begin our Letter where we ended the precedent. We have learn'd that thoſe among you which have not yet been prevailed on to go to Maſs, do nevertheleſs fill the Popiſh Churches at the hours of Service, and worſhip, particularly in great Cities, as <hi>Paris.</hi> You intend thereby to ſatisfie your Perſecutors in part, you think by this means to turn away, or at leaſt delay the violence wherewith they threaten you, that they may force you to go to Maſs, and communicate. And beſides you imagine that yon do no evil, becauſe you go to hear Men that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49990:46"/>preach the Word of God, tho not in a manner ſo pure as you deſire it; and you think your ſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently able to ſeparate the good from the bad. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over among Preachers you chuſe thoſe, that out of complaiſance and kindneſs to you, ſpeak little of Controverſie, and with very much moderation, and entertain you for the moſt part of the time with Truths which are common to us, with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Duties of Morality, the neceſſity whereof is acknowledged by all Chriſtians. It is better, ſay you, to hear the Word of God in this manner, than not to hear it at all. Behold, theſe are your Excuſes. But I pray, my Brethren, give heed to what I am about to ſay. You do not perceive whither this conduct will lead you. 1. In frequenting conſtantly the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Devotion of the Romiſh Religion, and being often in the Popiſh Churches, you will inſenſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate in the averſion you ought to have for thoſe places of Devotion, which Superſtition hath rendred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely profane. You enter without indignation into thoſe places in which the great God, jealous of his Honor, is provoked to jealouſie by Idolatry. You accuſtom your ſelves to ſee Images before which men proſtrate themſelves, and to which they give Religious Honor, contrary to the expreſs Commandment of that Law which was given in the midſt of Thunders, to ſignifie that the Tranſgreſſors thereof ſhould be ſmitten with the juſt Thunders of the Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. You behold without emotion thoſe Altars where that unhappy Sacrifice is offered, which is ſo great a ſhame to the Chriſtian Religion, and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to the reproach of Infidels, who reproach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as Furies, and mad Men, that offer their God in Sacrifice every day, and eat him when they have done. You account this nothing. We ſee the Images and Altars of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, you ſay, without indignation, but we have no Faith, or Veneration for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49990:47"/>their Myſteries, and in this reſpect we are at the ſame diſtance that ever we were. Alas, how ill are you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the windings and turnings of the Heart of Man! The Devil ſerves himſelf of every thing; by dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the averſion that you have had for the places where this Worſhip is performed, you will inſenſibly loſe your averſion for the Worſhip it ſelf. After you have beheld, without any emotion of mind, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars on which they ſacrifice, by little and little you will accuſtom your ſelves to be Spectators thereof, and in concluſion you will ſoon come to partake therein. Believe me, you can never be too much on your Guard againſt Error and Superſtition. They will gain upon you at ſuch places where your Guard is weak; and with much more eaſe will they find means to enter into you by ways ſo ſenſible, and ſo open. A Chriſtian, that hath any tenderneſs of Conſcience, grows into ſome paſſion when he goes into a Moſque; or into a Pagan Temple. A tender perſon cannot behold thoſe places, wherein his Parents or Friends have received violent outrages, without ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Spirit. And how can you, without any turning of your Bowels, enter into thoſe places, in which a Worſhip is practiſed, by which God is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and diſhonored, and for which hitherunto you have no kindneſs, or adherence? Do you not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that your Fathers were burnt, torn in pieces and quartered, becauſe they would not meddle with this falſe Worſhip, and that they ſacrificed them to thoſe Idols of Jealouſie that are before your Eyes? The memory of the outrages offered to the Blood that runs in your Veins, ſhould preſerve a juſt reſentment thereof in your minds.</p>
            <p>Conſider moreover that thereby you do not only accuſtom your ſelves to the places of Superſtition, but you do alſo habituate your ſelves to behold the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion on its beſt and faireſt ſide. They preach
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49990:47"/>to you the fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity; they diſplay with great pomp the moral Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt. In a little while you will come to ſay, yea, you do ſay it already, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion is not ſo bad as it hath been deſcribed; our Miniſters have deceived us. Unhappy people who labor to deceive your ſelves! Have we ever ſaid, that there was nothing of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion? Why have we received its Baptiſm, if there be nothing in it that is Chriſtian? But doth that which it hath of good hinder it from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an infinite number of things that are evil? 'Tis an Idol's Temple built upon the Chriſtian Religion, but 'tis an Idol's Temple for all that. 'Tis a part of the Church, but 'tis that part where the Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſits, according to the expreſs Prophecy of Saint <hi>Paul, That the ſon of perdition ought to ſit in the temple of God.</hi> Doth the good Morality that they preach, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from being true, that there are perſons tolerated there, that teach that we may commit ſins without offending God but in a venial manner? That we may kill to preſerve our Honor entire, and without ſpot? That we may ſteal with impunity? That we may continue in the habits of ſin, when we cannot free our ſelves of it? That ſimple Fornication is no great ſin? That Repentance is not neceſſary during life? That we may be ſaved without having exerciſed one ſingle act of love to God all the days of our life? That we may kill Kings when we are perſuaded that they are become Tyrants? We do not ſay that theſe Men are tolerated, but that they tolerate others; for they are far the greateſt number. They do not ſhew you Popery on that ſide, nor on the ſide of its Idolatries, Images, Saints, and Sainteſſes, which they have ſet ſo near to God, that they cauſe them to partake with him in his Glory: nor on the ſide of its Pilgrimages, and the Reliques which it adores, and a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Superſtitions: notwithſtanding it is certain, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49990:48"/>by accuſtoming your ſelves to like and fancy the Preachers of the Popiſh Church, you will ſoon come to like all that they ſhall pleaſe to preach, and teach you. When an object hath two faces, the one fair, and the other foul and deform'd, to the end that we preſerve in our ſelves that juſt averſion that we ought to have for it, 'tis neceſſary that we always look on it on the ill-favoured ſide. The way to Hell hath its Roſes, bus 'tis the way to Hell for all that. If you look not on it but on the ſide of its Flowers, you will forget that there are Thorns wherewith your Souls will be pierced, and wounded with wounds incurable. Once more, my Brethren, run not to thoſe Sermons where that which is good cannot pleaſe, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the hatred that you ought to have for the evil that is found there.</p>
            <p>This is not all; by going to theſe Sermons, you fill thoſe Churches where they celebrate thoſe unhappy Myſteries, for which you ought to have a very great averſation; and there you are at the very hour that thoſe Myſteries are celebrated. I underſtand, that from ſeven in the morning you fill theſe Churches, to hear a Sermon, which is not preached till nine or ten. And in the mean while, in the Chappels round about you they ſay Maſs, they elevate and adore the Hoſt; and you call that no going to Maſs, becauſe you have not your eyes preciſely turned towards the Prieſt that celebrates, and are not obliged to change your poſture in the moment of Elevation, becauſe you are removed at ſome diſtance from it. But good God! do you think, that he whoſe Eyes are ſo pure, and Spirit ſo clear, will approve a conduct ſo faulty? Is it not a conſent to Idolatry, to be found in the ſame place with Idolaters? They are there for the Maſs, and you are there for the Sermon. But in expectation of a Sermon don't you aſſiſt at the Maſs? You ſee it at a diſtance, but you will accuſtom your ſelves very
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49990:48"/>ſhortly to behold it nearer hand. And is it not to this very end and purpoſe, that at preſent they leave that, which they call the Holy Sacrament, always expoſed in their Churches, that you may not be able to enter there, without ſeeing perſons proſtrate at the Feet of the Altars of Superſtition, and being your ſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to bear a part in that criminal Worſhip.</p>
            <p>To conclude, you aſſiſt at the Sermons of theſe Popiſh Preachers with a great deal of diligence; are you aſſured of what they will tell you? At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they affect to ſpeak nothing to you, but things that will not affright you; but very ſhortly they will take the liberty to ſet the Opinions and Worſhip of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in open light. Are you aſſured you ſhall be able to reſiſt theſe deceitful Charms, theſe curious Devices, theſe falſe Appearances, theſe gilded Sophiſms, this ſtudied Eloquence, this Logick full of artifice, wherewith they ſerve themſelves to cover the uglineſs of Falſhood, and to obſcure the Beauty of Truth? 'Tis viſibly to expoſe your ſelves to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, againſt which God hath made no promiſe to protect you. So that, my Brethren, if you do not give over frequenting Popiſh Churches, I do foretel, that God will permit the bud of Truth, which is yet in you, to die, and that he will abandon you to a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay what ſhall we do then? Muſt we live without all Exerciſe of Religion? Muſt we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Word of God? No; but you muſt enquire after the Word of God in your Houſes, and amongſt your Brethren. You muſt aſſemble amongſt your ſelves as often as you can, read the Scripture together, and good Books of Chriſtian Morality, and you muſt recal what you can remember of former Sermons. You muſt mutually comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by good Prayers, and good Converſations, and good Diſcourſes, which without being ſtudied
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49990:49"/>are oftentimes of greater edification than Sermons, on which the fancy of a Preacher hath toiled and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored many days. To conclude, you muſt imitate the zeal of our Brethren of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken ſomething already, and will now go on to purſue their Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>☜ We left their Aſſemblies in the midſt of Winter. And we have ſeen, that in deſpite to the rigor of the ſeaſon, the Precipices wherewith the ways are bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the darkneſs of the night,, theſe believing Chriſtians did not fail to be found in thoſe places, in which they agreed to meet together, and pray to God. The laſt of the Aſſemblies whereof we ſpake in the precedent Letter, was that which was made in a place called <hi>Bebe.</hi> We have ſeen that the Prieſt and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Juſtice having removed themſelves thither, found no Body but the Wife of him that dwelt in the Farm with her Child. They carried her Priſoner, with many other perſons of the neighbouring places, which had not ſigned their Abjuration. They put them in the Caſtle of S <hi>John,</hi> where they were for the ſpace of a Month, to oblige them either to change, or to confeſs thoſe who were found at theſe Aſſemblies. They made them a Fire with Leaves and Straw, and all that which might make a dark and thick ſinoak to choke them. They endured this kind of Torment. At the end of a Month they ſeparated them, to the end they might cauſe them to fall the more eaſily. They ſaid to one that his companion had ſubſcribed; to another that he had confeſſed thoſe that were found at theſe Aſſemblies. All this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nothing, they carried theſe poor People to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where after three Months Impriſonment, they were condemned, and ſent to the Gallies, except one old Man, named <hi>Mauris,</hi> who was impriſoned with ſome Women in the Tower of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49990:49"/>
There happened at that time a thing conſiderable. A Man without Learning, of the Village of <hi>Colignac,</hi> being one night in Bed with his Father, believed he had a Viſion, and heard a Voice ſaying, <hi>Go comfort my People.</hi> I know not whether it were the force of his zeal, and imagination which produced this effect, or whether it were actually a Voice from Heaven; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it were, all the reaſonings and warnings of his Father, who turned both his Viſion and Deſign into Ridicule, could not hinder him from following this Call, which he eſteemed as coming from Heaven: he gathered Aſſemblies, he ſpake there with ſo much ſucceſs, and with ſo much order and method, for a perſon of his quality, that every one was ſurpriſed at it, and all that heard him edified by it. Under his Direction Aſſemblies were made of three thouſand perſons; amongſt others, one in a place called <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> near S. <hi>Hypolite,</hi> and another in a Farm of the Parſonage of S. <hi>Roman,</hi> ſituate upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Gezas,</hi> there were full five and twenty hundred perſons in that Aſſembly. After the Sermon they named many Elders for the ſeveral parts of <hi>Cevennes,</hi> and charged them with giving notice of the places, and hours of Aſſemblies. Of theſe many have been ſince taken, and ſent to the Gallies, as Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> of S. <hi>Hypolite,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Nadal</hi> of the Village <hi>de la Salle.</hi> There is no danger in naming of them, and 'tis an Honor we owe them, ſeeing they are at this day among the Confeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt, in the Gallies of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> or <hi>Thoulon.</hi> Many others, which we will not name, becauſe they are not taken, were hanged in effigie. In the ſame Aſſembly they agreed to give to him, that ſhould preach to them, power to adminiſter the Sacraments. In which we may not imagine that they committed any Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the true Call depends on the People, and on the choice of Aſſemblies. The Miſſion of one Paſtor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49990:50"/>by another is but a form, which ought to be obſerved in peaceful times of the Church, but may be neglected in caſes of neceſſity. Before they departed they cauſed all thoſe that were preſent, to enter into new obligations, not to go to Maſs; and reſolved to make another Aſſembly the Wedneſday following, between S. <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Durfort.</hi> The Curate of S. <hi>Roman</hi> (or the Incumbent whereof the Farm depended, where this Aſſembly was made) cauſed a Veſſel of Holy Water to be carried thither, and ſprinkled it about every where, to expiate the place, as if the Devil had kept a Sabbath there.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly was made the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following according to the project, and there met near four thouſand perſons, which was the cauſe they left the Farm which at firſt they had choſen, and aſſembled in a Field, and hung up Lamps on a Pear-Tree that was found there. This Aſſembly was diſcovered, they ſent thither ſome Dragoons under the Conduct of one called <hi>Villeneufeu,</hi> an Apoſtate of the Town <hi>de la Salle;</hi> but the Dragoons durſt not draw near, becauſe they believed themſelves too weak to attack ſo great a people: therefore they kept themſelves in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade, and when the people began to depart, they took of them ſuch as they could. Among others one named <hi>Pouget,</hi> of the Town of <hi>Valeſtalieres.</hi> They Arreſted alſo ſome days after in his own Houſe, Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier,</hi> of the Town of <hi>Durfort,</hi> who freely confeſſed that he was at the Aſſembly of St. <hi>Felix.</hi> Among many Priſoners, they choſe <hi>Pouget</hi> of <hi>Valeſtalieres,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier</hi> of <hi>Durfort,</hi> to make examples, as they ſpeak, that is to ſay, to make Victims of their fury. They were condemned to dye in the Village <hi>de la Salle,</hi> by the Intendant, and Preſident of <hi>Niſmes.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier</hi> publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Crime for which he dyed, and declared that if he had eſcaped their hands he had continued
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49990:50"/>it, and would yet continue it if it were poſſible for him. Upon the Ladder he ſung theſe words of Pſalm xxxi. <hi>Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit, for thou haſt redeemed me O God of truth. Pouget</hi> was ſo weak as to change his Religion on promiſe that they would give him his life, but they hanged him for all that. Their vengeance did not ſtay upon theſe Victims, it proceeded even to things inanimate. They pulled the Farm down to the ground where the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was made, they plucked up the Pear-Tree by the Roots, on which they hung the Lamps, that they might ſee to ſing Pſalms: It is a circumſtance very ſingular, and which makes known how far the fury of falſe Zeal may go. It is well nigh to what they do by the places where Sorcerers have celebrated their horrible Myſteries, and where <hi>Sodomites</hi> have exerciſed their abominable Brutalities. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on this occaſion a thing which ſeems to me very ſurprizing. It is that at the ſame hour that they condemned Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier</hi> of <hi>Durfort</hi> to dye for having been at Aſſemblies; one was made at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in a Farm of Sr. <hi>Roman,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>de la Salle,</hi> where there were found fourteen, or fifteen hundred perſons. And the day after the Execution, another was made at mid-day alſo, near to <hi>Valerangue:</hi> whilſt they were at Sermon an Apoſtate named <hi>Couchon,</hi> of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> went away, and made haſt to advertiſe the Dragoons thereof, which were in their Quarters at <hi>Valerangue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Intendant, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Trouſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a rage, when they ſaw that nothing would hinder theſe nightly Aſſemblies, cauſed ſome Files of Dragoons to be drawn off, which ran too and fro all night over the Mountains, but they could meet with no Aſſemblies. But they made Priſoners all the ſingle perſons that they found, ſuppoſing they had been at Aſſemblies, or were going to them. The Lords Day
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49990:51"/>after the death of Monſieur <hi>Teiſſier,</hi> another Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was made on the top of the Mountain <hi>Liron,</hi> to the number of four or five hundred perſons. A while after there was another in a Farm near St. <hi>Germain:</hi> it was ſo numerous that the Planchers of the Room cracked and brake under the weight of them. But there was none hurt but one old Man, whom they were forced to carry away. The day after there was another near <hi>Connas.</hi> Whilſt they were preaching, a Sentinel, that they had ſet at the entrance of the place, went and advertiſed the Dragoons, and Curate of S. <hi>Germain,</hi> and betrayed the Aſſembly. The Dragoons diſcharged upon theſe poor people, who had no other intention than to pray to God. Many were left upon the place dead, and wounded; others betook themſelves to flight, and in flying fell into a great Gulph of Waters, where a great number of them were drowned; others hid themſelves in the Rocks, whither the Soldiers went, and apprehended them. 'Twas in one of theſe Aſſemblies that one of the Gentlewomen of <hi>Belcaſtell</hi> was wounded, by a great blow on the Head. A Prieſt or Jeſuit ſtanding by, cryed out, <hi>Make an end of her.</hi> But nevertheleſs they were content with leading her, and many others, away Priſoners.</p>
            <p>A few days after another Aſſembly was made, near a place called <hi>Boucovitan,</hi> where there were found full two thouſand perſons, and there they gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Many perſons which were preſent at this Aſſembly were diſcovered, and made Priſoners, and the Men were ſent to the Gallies.</p>
            <p>We here take no notice of any Aſſemblies, but thoſe that are conſiderable, for a great number of others have been made in Caves, and Woods, and private Houſes, and the moſt part of them have been made peaceably enough, and without being diſcovered. It was this inconceivable firmneſs of reſolution to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49990:51"/>aſſemble in deſpight to ſo many puniſhments, and perſecutions, which produced that terrible, Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> laſt, by which the penalty of death is impoſed upon all thoſe that ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of having exerciſed any Religion but that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Before that time, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had orders to put to the Sword all ſuch as were found at Aſſemblies. And they diſcharged their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion very well, as it appears by what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported concerning the precedent Aſſemblies, which were all made ſince <hi>October</hi> on the laſt year, and <hi>June</hi> on this. It was thought that the Order that the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had to Maſſacre, and the Declaration of the twelfth of <hi>July,</hi> would have put an end to theſe Aſſemblies. Nevertheleſs they are as frequent as ever, and many times at mid-day. And from that time there have been Maſſacres and effuſion of blood.</p>
            <p>On the thirtieth of <hi>June</hi> there was an Aſſembly of about two thouſand perſons, upon the Road, from <hi>Calmette</hi> to <hi>Barutet.</hi> The Dragoons of <hi>Niſmes</hi> were there, and took about thirty or forty Priſoners, which they carried to the Tower of <hi>Vineliere,</hi> it is a Tower that is joyned to the Walls of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> above the <hi>Arones.</hi> The <hi>Thurſday</hi> following there were two Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, the one at St. <hi>Ceſari,</hi> a Village half a League from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> the other at Iron Croſs, which is not above a quarter of a League from the ſame City. There have been many others in thoſe parts, and every where there have been Maſſacres, blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and perſons Hanged upon the place, and great numbers made Priſoners. But the moſt conſiderable Maſſacre was that which was made near <hi>Uzes</hi> upon the Road to <hi>Bagnol.</hi> Upon the ſeventh of the month of <hi>July,</hi> there were found on that place twelve hundred perſons. The Dragoons of <hi>Uzes</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereof, haſted thither, and found them at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49990:52"/>their Devotions. They compaſſed them round. Theſe Chriſtians did nothing, but with Hands, and Eyes lift up to Heaven, fell on their Knees, and in that poſture expected death. The Dragoons diſcharged upon theſe poor people without Arms, and without defence. They ſucceeded ſo well therein, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the wounded, the field was covered with the dead. An Eye witneſs that paſſed over the place three weeks after, found then there the bodies of thirty Women half rotten. Beſides this, the Dragoons ſtrangled many with the Halters of their Horſes. They took more than three hundred Women, which they knocked, and beat upon the Breaſt and Sides with their Daggers, they cut off their Coats to their Hips, they ſtripped them naked, and having covered themſelves with their Cloths, they returned with their ſpoils, and Priſoners to <hi>Uzes.</hi> Behold on one ſide how the Devil defends his Goſpel. And on the other part, it was thus that the Primitive Chriſtians, and our firſt Reformers planted the Goſpel of Chriſt in the midſt of Paganiſm, and Antichriſtianiſm, that is to ſay by Courage, Patience, and Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Since the month of <hi>July, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Ceven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> have been a field of blood, and ſlaughter. The Dragoons, under pretence of Aſſemblies, kill all they meet, and Letters from thoſe Countries report that a Man can ſcarcely take four ſteps upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains without finding a Carcaſe, either Hanging on a Tree, or lying on the ground. On the thirteenth of <hi>July,</hi> a Lieutenant of Dragoons having been informed that there was a Man near the old Caſtle of <hi>Vauvert,</hi> about three Leagues from <hi>Niſmes,</hi> that ſung Pſalms, he ran thither, and finds this poor Man at the foot of a Tree, reading in his Pſalm Book, having no other company, but another poor Man ſleeping by him. He cauſed this to Hang the other upon the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ot. The Intendant, and Marqueſs of <hi>Trouſſe,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49990:52"/>commended this action. A little before this a barbarous action was committed upon a Gentleman of five or ſix thouſand Crowns Annual Rent, at the Bridge of <hi>Montvert</hi> in <hi>Gevaudan.</hi> This Gentleman that he might avoid the temptation of Abjuring his Religion, had paſſed ſeven or eight months in Caves. At laſt being forced from thence, being able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt there no longer, he returned to his Houſe. As ſoon as the Commander of the Dragoons had notice of it, he ſent a Detachment of eight or ten Dragoons, who having found him at one of his Houſes, wounded him in the preſence of his Wife, Plundered the Houſe, threatned to cut off her Fingers, becauſe ſhe refuſed to give them the Rings that were on them. The Gentleman at the end of five days dyed of his wounds, and being about to expire, he called the Villain that wounded him, (for he never ſtirred from his Houſe) he took him by the Hand, and aſſured him that he forgave him with all his Heart, and in this diſpoſition of mind gave up his Soul to God. The Widow with three Children that ſhe had, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> the Children were taken from her, and ſent to <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> and ſhe had liberty to go whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe pleaſed upon her word.</p>
            <p>All theſe cruelties have nothing abated the Zeal of the Reformed in this Country. They continue their Aſſemblies, although they have taken from them one of their principal Guides, under whoſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Conduct they held and obſerved them. It is Monſieur <hi>Fulcran Rey,</hi> a Native of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and a Student in Theology, who was hanged at <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> on the ſeventh of the month of <hi>July.</hi> I promiſed you an exact relation concerning him; but it hath been Printed ſince that time: it is worth your ſearch and inquiry, that you may know the acts of the paſſion of this Martyr; we ſhall content our ſelves to obſerve here the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal paſſages thereof, to the end that if theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49990:53"/>go further than the intire relation thereof, thoſe which ſhall not be able to read that, may know at leaſt ſomething thereof here.</p>
            <p>This young Man was not above twenty four years of age when he ſuffered Martyrdom. He had been Conſecrated from his childhood to Divinity, by his Father and Mother. By the Declaration of <hi>October</hi> in the year paſt, he was obliged to go out of the Kingdom in fifteen days, as well as the other Miniſters of the Goſpel: he either could not, or would not go out in the time appointed, inſomuch that he was found and impriſoned in the Kingdom, and expoſed to the penalty of the Gallies, according to the terms of the Declaration in caſe he were taken. God put it into his Heart to uſe no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to go out, which without doubt he might have found, as well as ſo many others, who had that advantage. As yet he was only Student in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the malignancy of the times hindering him from Ordination, but an extraordinary Call ſupplied that defect. He underſtood that when the Houſe was on fire, all the World ought put to their hand for the extinguiſhing thereof, and that God who derives Praiſe from Children that ſuck, may very well ſerve himſelf of him to edifie his Servants, notwithſtanding his Youth and meanneſs of Learning. He traverſed the whole Province of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> He went from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taub</hi> to <hi>Milhaw,</hi> from thence to St. <hi>Affrique,</hi> from thence to the Bridge of <hi>Cammares,</hi> from thence to <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> every where ſearching out perſons that were willing to be edified. But the fear was then ſo great, that it had ſtifled all other Thoughts and Sentiments. Nevertheleſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a little, and this young Man found oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to gather ſome Aſſemblies in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> which coſt liberty, or life to many perſons, for of them ſome were Hanged, Maſſacred,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49990:53"/>and Impriſoned, and others ſent to the Gallies. And this put a ſtop to the courſe of theſe Aſſemblies, and our Martyr himſelf ran a great hazard by the treachery of one named <hi>Audoyer,</hi> which made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of friendſhip to him. He eſcaped this danger becauſe his hour was not yet come, and God would yet make uſe of him ſome time for his Work. After he had made ſome Journeys to and fro on the borders of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> at laſt he returned to <hi>Cevennes,</hi> where he found a great many people diſpoſed to hear him, and he reſolved to fix himſelf to the edification of that part of the Country, becauſe he believed he ſhould there do moſt good. Nevertheleſs well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he could not long eſcape the vigilance of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, who had filled that Country with Dragoons and Spies, he wrote to his Father a Letter of fare. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l, by which he declared he was perfectly ready to offer himſelf in Sacrifice to God, and ſuffer Martyrdom, and prepared his Father to hear ſoon the News of his being taken, and conſequently of his death. This preſage was not falſe, for it was not two months wherein he had edified the Faithful by his Sermons, by his Viſits, and his private Diſcourſes, before he was apprehended at <hi>Auduze</hi> by the falſeneſs of one <hi>Almeras,</hi> an Inhabitant of that Village. This wretch had accompanied our Martyr in all the places of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennes</hi> where he had been, inſomuch that he believed he had reaſon to confide abſolutely in him. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it was he that delivered him into the hands of the Dragoons. He was then at a Houſe out of the Village, they took him on a <hi>Saturday</hi> night, whilſt he was employed in Meditation. One of the Miniſters of the fury of the Perſecutors took him by the Hair, caſt him to the ground, and cruelly beat him. Our Martyr complained thereof with great moderation, adding that God would puniſh him for an outrage ſo unjuſt. This Propheſie had its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49990:54"/>for the Soldier was ſlain two days after by one of his Companions, with whom he engaged in a quarrel. The Martyr was put in the Priſon of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duze,</hi> where he was loaden with Chains, and treated with all the ſeverity they uſe to exerciſe towards the greateſt Criminals. It was there he was firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, they asked him whether he had Preached. He confeſſed it, and gloried therein, and declared that he had done his duty, and that he would yet do the ſame thing if he were in condition. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to learn from him the places where he had Preached, and what perſons had been preſent at his Sermons. But to that he would ſay nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would bring no perſon to hazard. After he had undergone this interrogatory, they put him into the hands of thirty Dragoons which carried him to the Priſon of <hi>Alez,</hi> where he was to undergo the Perſecution of the Monks of all Orders, beſides the ſeverity of the Judges. But he anſwered to all theſe people with firmneſs, and an admirable preſence of mind, which touched them with admiration and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; a ſentiment which is not ordinary with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Character, when they are Perſecuting true Chriſtians. They ſaw well, that ſeeing the Monks were touched with his Diſcourſes, they might produce the ſame effect upon others, for which reaſon they forbad all perſons to ſee him. A few days after they took him from the Priſon of <hi>Alez,</hi> to remove him to that of <hi>Niſmes.</hi> Thoſe that had been hindred from ſeeing him when he was in Priſon, were willing to recompence the loſs which they had ſuſtained; an incredible multitude of people of all Ages, and Sexes, pouring out tears, followed him on the Road, accompanying him with their Prayers and good wiſhes: he returned them bleſſings, and added vehement Exhortations to riſe ſpeedily from their fall, and to glorifie God, as he did, by their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49990:54"/>Sufferings. Whilſt he was in Priſon at <hi>Alez,</hi> there were no ways imaginable which were not employed to oblige him to change his Religion. The Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks ſerved themſelves of ways of Seduction, the Judges with that of Authority. They promiſed him not only impunity for what was paſt, but all kinds of Favours and Advantages. He equally reſiſted all, and with the ſame courage ſurmounted theſe different temptations. Whilſt they carried him From the Priſon of <hi>Alez</hi> to that of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> approaching the place of his Nativity, and that where his Father and Kindred dwelt, he felt ſome movings of his Bowels, which made him fear, leſt that ſhould be the place where he was to endure the ſtrongeſt temptations, through the ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of nature. He earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of the Judges, that they would not let him ſee neither his Father, nor his Relations. Therefore he did not ſee them, but was content to let them know, that they might be aſſured of his ſtability, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and perfect reſignation to the will of God. They kept him but a few days in the Priſon of <hi>Niſmes:</hi> the Monks and Eccleſiaſticks of that City engaged him in new Combats, but 'twas with as little ſucceſs as thoſe that went before. They had no intention to put him to death at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> becauſe that City was full of Men of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion. They feared either ſome emotion, or at leaſt, that the beholding the Martyrdom of this young Man, and his Conſtancy, ſhould waken the Conſcience of a great many People, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the truth in their Heart, hid it under the veil of Diſſimulation. They carried him therefore from <hi>Niſmes</hi> to <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> a Village where all the People are of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. 'Twas there his Proceſs was to be made, and he to receive the Crown of Marty<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 'Twas there alſo he was to ſuſtain the moſt terrible Aſſaults. The Intendent was preſent, who
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49990:55"/>began by Engines of Sweetneſs and Promiſes, adding thereunto all that which is moſt terrible in death. But to his Promiſes he anſwered, <hi>I love not the world, nor the things of the world, I eſteem all thoſe advantages whereof you ſpeak as dung, I tread them under my feet.</hi> Unto the threatnings of puniſhment he ſaid, <hi>My life is not at all dear to me, if ſo be I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and gain Jeſus Chriſt, whatſoever death is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for me, it will be always glorious if I ſuffer it for God, and for the ſame cauſe for the which my Saviour died.</hi> An incredible company of other people came to ſee him in the Priſon, all to the ſame end; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was forgotten of all that which might ſoften the mind, and weaken the firmneſs of his courage. All theſe means being unſucceſsful, in concluſion the Intendent proceeded to his condemnation. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the Bar: when he was there, the Intendent ſaid to him, <hi>Mr.</hi> Rey, <hi>there is yet time for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Yea, my Lord,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>and for that reaſon I will employ the time that remains, in endeavouring my ſalvation.</hi> He replyed to him: <hi>But you muſt change, and you ſhall have life. Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I muſt change, but 'tis to go from this miſerable world, and go to the Kingdom of Heaven, where a happy life attends me, which I ſhall ſpeedily enjoy: don't promiſe me the preſent life, I am intirely diſengaged from it, death is much more eligible. If I had been afraid of death, you had not ſeen me here. God hath cauſed me to underſtand his truth, and does me the honor to die for it. Speak no more to me of the good things of the world, they have no ſavour or taſte with me; for all the Treaſures of the Earth I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that which I expect in Heaven.</hi> When the Judges ſaw him thus firm and ſtedfaſt, they gave over vexing him about his Religion, and proceeded to make his Proceſs. He anſwered to all their Queſtions with a reſpect, ſweetneſs, and moderation, which melted all the Auditors. When they were ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49990:55"/>his Sentence, they ſolicited him anew to have pity on himſelf, and not by an unhappy obſtinacy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a Life which was given him to preſerve. I <hi>am no more,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in condition to adviſe about what I am to do; I have made my choice, here is no farther place for bargains, I am ready to die, if God hath ſo appointed it. All the promiſes which can be made will never be able to ſhake me, nor hinder me from rendering what I owe to my God.</hi> Therefore they read his Sentence, by which he was condemned to be hanged, and put to the Rack before he was led to the Gibbet. He heard his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence read without any commotion; and when it was ended, he ſaid, <hi>They treat me more gently than they treated my Saviour, in condemning me to ſo eaſie a death; I had prepared my ſelf to be broken on the wheel, or be burnt.</hi> And lifting up his eyes to Heaven, he added, <hi>I give thee thanks, Lord of Heaven and Earth, for all the Bleſſings that thou haſt beſtowed upon me. I give thee thanks, that thou haſt found me worthy to ſuffer for thy Goſpel, and die for thee. I give thee thanks alſo, for that thou haſt called me to ſuffer ſo eaſie a death, after I had prepared my Heart to ſuffer the moſt cruel death for thee.</hi> In execution of the Sentence he was put upon the Rack, he ſuffered it without any complaint, or one word of murmuring; anſwering no other thing, but that he had ſaid all, and had nothing more to anſwer. And when he was taken from the Rack, turning to the Judges, he told them, <hi>I have not ſuffered the pain which you would have made me ſuffer, I believe that you have ſuffered more than I, I have had no ſenſe of pain, I do profeſs before you.</hi> 'Tis an extraordinary effect of Grace; for altho we ſhould not give credit to thoſe relations which tell us that the Rack was ſo violent, that it was believed, that he could not have made uſe of his Legs to go to execution; it is nevertheleſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that naturally it cannot happen, that a perſon ſhould be on thoſe Inſtruments of Torment without
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49990:56"/>feeling very great pains. But 'tis a Miracle which hath a hundred and a hundred Examples in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Martyrs, both of the ancient Church, and that of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>They bring back our Martyr to the place where he was to prepare himſelf for death: he dined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would have it ſo; and whilſt he was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſaid to thoſe that gave him his meat, very calmly, <hi>Others eat to live, and I eat to die; this is the laſt Repaſt that I ſhall take upon earth; but againſt the Evening there is prepared a Banquet in the Heavens, to which I am invited, and whither I ſhall be conducted by the Angels. Theſe happy Spirits will ſuddenly remove me to make me partaker with them of the Delights of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> The reſt of the day they let looſe upon him many Monks, who received no other Fruits of their Aſſaults but diſappointment, and confuſion. Amidſt all thoſe Diſtractions, into which they endeavoured to caſt him, he employed himſelf in ſinging of Pſalms, in lifting up his Soul to God, and preſenting fervent Prayers to him. About the Evening, as he went forth of the Priſon, to go to Execution, two Monks drew near to him, ſaying, <hi>We are here to accompany, and comfort you.</hi> He anſwered them: <hi>I have no need of you, I have a Comforter that is more faithful, and which is within me for my Conſolation. I have a Guard of Angels round about my Perſon, and which have aſſured me they will be with me to my laſt Breath.</hi> He marched toward the place of Execution with an appearance of ſatisfaction, and tranquillity of Spirit viſible to all the Spectators; and having obſerved ſome of our Brethren, that were fallen, pouring out floods of tears while they ſaluted him, ſaid to them, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, I ſhall be ſoon out of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and far from this Vale of Tears; but I ſee, and leave you there. In the name of God recover, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and he will have pity upon you.</hi> When he was in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49990:56"/>a place and diſtance that he could ſee the Gibbet, where he was to end his Combat, he cryed out with tranſport of Joy, <hi>Be ſtrong, be ſtrong, this is the place which I long ſince propoſed to my ſelf, and for which God himſelf hath prepared me; how welcome doth this place appear to me? I there ſee the Heavens open to receive me, and Angels coming to accompany me thither.</hi> He would afterward have ſung a Pſalm, as he drew near to the Gibbet; but the Judges, which ſaw, that the Crowd was moved, and pierced, by the ſigns and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his conſtancy, impoſed ſilence on him, and forbad him to ſing. He obeyed, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him; and arriving to the Foot of the Ladder, he ſaid, <hi>Oh, how welcome is this Ladder to me! ſine it muſt ſerve me as a ſtep to finiſh my courſe, and mount to Heaven.</hi> They permitted him to ſay his Prayers at the Foot of the Ladder. And when he was aſcended, he ſaw Monks aſcending after him, which obliged him to repel them, ſaying. <hi>Retire; I have told you, and I tell you again, I have no need of your ſuccor. I receive enough from my God to enable me to take the laſt ſtep of my Journey.</hi> He would have gone on, and given a Reaſon of his Faith to that innumerable Crowd of People, above which he was raiſed. But they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the effect of a Sermon preached from ſuch a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, and by ſuch a Preacher. They well foreſaw, that he would ſpeak, and therefore had ſet round about the Gibbet many Drums, which they appointed to be beaten at once. 'Tis a new kind of Gag, which is not altogether ſo frightful, as that of another kind, but produces the ſame effect. The Spirit of Hell is always the ſame, and hath always the ſame fears. He hath often felt the force of thoſe Preachers which preach from Gibbets, and out of the Piles of Wood, he fears their Eloquence, and judges it moſt ſafe to impoſe ſilence on them. Our Martyr therefore ſpeaks not but for himſelf, but his Countenance, his Eyes, his Hands
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49990:57"/>beſpeak his Courage, his Faith, and Conſtancy; and this Language was ſo effectual, that the Village of <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> altho wholly plunged in darkneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices for Popery, was moved thereby in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner.</p>
            <p>I do very earneſtly wiſh, that three or four ſorts of perſons would make Reflections on this death.
<list>
                  <item>1. The Enemies of Truth. Is it poſſible, that they cannot obſerve therein the Character of true Religion? I do conjure them to conſider what moſt reſembles Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, whether a Man that dies, as we have ſeen this young Man die, or perſons which cauſe him to die for his Religion, and becauſe he would not renounce it?</item>
                  <item>2. I ſet this Object before the Eyes of the new Converts, who being ſeduced either by their Paſſions, or Illuſions, behold the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they have left as abominable, and ſuch wherein the Spirit of God is not to be found, can they well perſuade themſelves, that ſo much Courage, ſo much Piety, ſo much Conſtancy, ſo much Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo much Sweetneſs doth proceed from him, who is the Father of Lies, and the Fountain of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations? If it be the Spirit of God which produces theſe miraculous effects in our Martyrs, then our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is not deprived of it, then God has not forſaken us, then we are not out of his Church, out of which there is neither Grace, nor Holy Spirit.</item>
               </list> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I demand here the attention of the weak, of thoſe Men who bleſs themſelves becauſe they yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Truth in their Hearts, and which perſwade themſelves, that the Fault which they have committed in ſubſcribing is very light, I demand of them, are not you obliged to do what this Martyr has done? Has he given to God more than he owed him? Who is he that is not obliged to ſeal and confirm the Truth by his Sufferings? You have withdrawn your ſelves from paying that which you have received from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49990:57"/>God, in the opportunities which he has offered you. And you have withdrawn your ſelves by a faulty weakneſs, and negligence, by a lye both of Heart and Hand. In what eſtate ſhould we be, if God had not left us a Remnant? We ſhould be like unto <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> we ſhould not have had one Martyr, <hi>i. e.</hi> one Witneſs of the Truth of our Lord Jeſus. You will ſay, all are not capable of ſuffering Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. At leaſt confeſs then, that you are in this reſpect in a great degree of Imperfection, and that your Fault is great. Don't juſtifie your ſelves at all, recover your ſelves by Repentance, if you would that God ſhould pardon you.</p>
            <p>I have given you the Hiſtory of the Vigor which our Brethren of <hi>Languedoc</hi> have had to continue their Aſſemblies without interruption, and thereby expoſe themſelves to Martyrdom and Death, with deſign to convince you of that which I have proved in the beginning of this Letter, <hi>i.e.</hi> that you ought not to procure to your ſelves conſolation by hearing the Word of God in Popiſh Churches, where you will find it ſeaſoned, and tempered in a way mortal to your Souls.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary, that you ſearch it after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that our Brethren (of which I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have done. I know well that your Fleſh hath many things to ſay to me concerning it. Some will ſay they are a great People in that Country, and we are here but a handful of Men. The more eaſily m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y you communicate together, the fewer you are in number, the leſs are your motions perceived. Others will ſay, theſe People are favoured by the ſituation of their Country, we are in Cities where they watch us night and day. Hath the ſituation of their Country hindered them from the danger of being diſcovered, hanged, and ſent to the Gallies? Have they been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by having been diſcovered once, yea, twenty
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49990:58"/>times? I do declare to you on the behalf of God, if you don't renounce this Spirit of Fear, and put on the Spirit of Martyrs, God will forſake vou; you will not find a Man that will be able to comfort you; yea, you will not receive Letters to ſupport you. You are afraid of the ſhadow of danger. God will be very much beholden to you, you will love him, and you will enquire after him when there ſhall be no danger therein. But 'tis at preſent, that you ought to make it appear, whether you yet love God, in expoſing your ſelves to all dangers, and often as you ſearch conſolation for your Souls, and edification for your Faith. I pray God to have pity on your ſtate, and that he will give you ſuch ſentiments as you ought to have. The Grace of our Lord be given to you again. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <salute>My well beloved Brethren in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN our third Letter, we promiſed to give you a brief Hiſtory of the changes that have happened in Chriſtianity, in the firſt five hundred years of the Church, that from thence you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the-unfaithfulneſs of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and your Converters, which tell you with ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, that Chriſtianity is come down from the Apoſtles to them without alteration. We have been obliged to delay the performance of that promiſe, that we might make ſome reflections upon an infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that hath been given us concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the new Converts. This was the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our fourth Letter. We will return again at this time to the matter which we have diſcontinued, and give a ſhort pourtraiture, and deſcription of the Chriſtianity of the firſt Age, that you may ſee the changes that have happened in the Ages following</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:49990:59"/>
               <head>The firſt Age of the Church.</head>
               <p>WE cannot know the opinions, and practices of an Age, with any certainty but by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of that Age. We have no Authors of the firſt Age of the Church, but the Apoſtles and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts And though others ſhould be found, that may be referred to that firſt Age, we ſhall leave them to the ſecond, to which alſo they do belong, becauſe it is certain that thoſe, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts) do ſuffice to teach us what was the Religion of the Apoſtolick Church. It is above all things juſt, that we ſee what was the Religion of that firſt Age, and by conſequence we muſt conſult the Writers of it. This is the more certain, becauſe they were Divinely inſpired, and are the only infallible Doctors that we have. In ſo much that if the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion be founded in theſe infallible Writers, we are content that you abandon, and give up your ſelves to your Converters. But on the contrary, if nothing thereof be found there, it is juſt that you believe, that all that we reject hath been added to the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>It is a prodigy that ſurpaſſes all belief, that Popery ſhould be the Chriſtian Religion, and that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof ſhould not ſpeak one word concerning it. It is true, the Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, learn us to believe one God in three Perſons, and one Son of God made Man, who dyed for the ſins of Mankind, Roſe again, Aſcended into Heaven, and will come again to judge the quick and the dead, and to ſend one part of them into everlaſting Torments, and to give the other Rewards infinite, for extent and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But this is not Popery, this is Chriſtianity. Popery is a Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of our Lord, every day offered to God for the ſins of the living
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49990:59"/>and the dead. It is a new Jeſus made of Bread, deſcending at all hours between the Hands of the Prieſt, which they adore as the great God. It is the Worſhip, and Invocation of a ſecond ſort of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and Interceſſor, to whom they build Temples, erect Images, and Altars, to whoſe honor they Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe name they ſwear, to whom they make Vows, and in one word to whom they give all thoſe divine Honors that are given to God himſelf. It is an intermediate ſtate betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, called Purgatory, in which for a time Souls endure the pains of fire, and the torments of the damned; Purgatory which is the foundation of a thouſand other Worſhips, Penances, Prayers for the dead, Maſſes, indulgences, Stations, Jubilees, Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, and human ſatisfactions. To conclude, for I will nor ſay all, Popery is an inſtitution of a new Head, and Spouſe for the Church, into whole hands the Lord Jeſus hath committed all his Authority, and Rights to pluck up, and to plant, to build, and to deſtroy, to bind and to looſe, to make and unmake Kings, and to keep the Keys of Heaven and Hell. Behold what Popery is, and once more I will ſay, it is a prodigy that God ſhould give us Scripture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in his Religion, and that he ſhould not ſay one word of the greateſt, and moſt conſiderable parts of it there. In the Name of God, my Brethren, be not taken in this unhappy ſnare, into which I perceive that ſome of you are fallen. The Scripture could not ſay all, ſay they, it hath left Commiſſion to the Church to ſay the reſt. Now is it poſſible that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can permit themſelves to be taken by ſo groſs an illuſion? If the thing under debate were ſmall, peradventure it might be conceded, but it is about Adoration of the Sacrament, that is to ſay a piece of Bread, and giving religious Worſhip to Creatures, and Images. The thing debated is about Celebration
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49990:60"/>of a Sacrifice, the moſt important thing in the World in Religion, yea about the Sacrificing of Chriſt himſelf, the greateſt Sacrifice that can be imagined. And can it be believed that God will ſend us to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition concerning it. It is to have renounced all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty to advance ſuch a propoſition, and to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous even to blindneſs, to believe it. Therefore if I can prove that the Scripture ſays nothing at all for the eſtabliſhment of Popery, I have gained my Cauſe, at leaſt for the firſt Age, in which I now am, and have proved ſufficiently that Popery was then unknown. Let us proceed to ſome of its Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifice of the Maſs makes a great figure in the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and holds a principal place there. It is the Idol for which they have the greateſt jealouſie. We cannot better underſtand what hath been the Opinion, and Sentiment of the Church in all Ages, concerning it, than from the Ceremonies, Actions, and Words which have been practiſed in the Celebration of the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>To ſearch the Sacrifice of the Maſs in the Old Teſtament, as the Papiſts do, is an extravagance that hath no example, for the Old Teſtament ſpeaks only of the Worſhip, and Ceremonies of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Religion. To ſearch it in other Texts of the New Teſtament, than thoſe which teach us the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of its Celebration, is to ſearch it where naturally it ought not to be found. It is therefore preciſely in the Inſtitution of that Sacrifice that we muſt find the Nature of it. Now the Evangeliſts, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us with one conſent, that what Chriſt Jeſus did in that memorable Action is there. <hi>The night in which he was betrayed, he took Bread, he bleſſed it, brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying take eat, this is my Body. Afterwards he took the Cup, bleſſed it alſo, and ſaid this Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood, which
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49990:60"/>is ſhed for you, drink ye all of it, take, and divide it among your ſelves, do this in remembrance of me. In fine they ſung a Hymn, that certain Pſalms according to the Cuſtom of the</hi> Jews. <hi>They aroſe, and ſo the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was ended.</hi> On that, I beſeech you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, call to witneſs the Conſciences of your Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and Converters, and enquire a little of them, what there is in it, that can have any reſemblance with the Maſs? Where is the Gradual, the Introit, the Canon, the <hi>Ite, Miſſa eſt?</hi> But you will ſay theſe are but indifferent Ceremonies, which may be added. It is a great queſtion whether they might be added, yea, or no. Nevertheleſs let us let that Point alone at preſent. Let them ſhew you at leaſt what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial therein. Where is the Oblation? Where is the Elevation? Where is the Adoration? Where is the Genuflection? Where is the Sacrifice, and preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Victim? Jeſus Chriſt took Bread, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying this is my Body. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church theſe words are not ſaid to the Communicant, they are ſaid at the Conſecration, a long time before the Communion. Jeſus Chriſt gave Bread to his Diſciples to be eaten without Cremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or Myſtery. They were ſitting, or rather lying upon Beds, at a Table, as the manner of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents was. It was a prodigious ſtupidity in the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not to caſt themſelves on the ground, and Adore the great Miracle of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Real Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, lying hid under the Species of Bread and Wine, whilſt they bore him in their own proper Hands. Theſe ignorant perſons ſo prone to admiration, who Adored Chriſt Jeſus when he appeaſed a ſtorm at Sea, which was an action aſſuredly, that a Spirit of a Nature infinitely inferior to God could do, would they not have Adored him, when he did a Work ſo great as the Creation of the World. But if the Diſciples were ſo ſtupid as not to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49990:61"/>Adore this Miſtery, would Jeſus Chriſt be ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as to ſuffer them in this ſtate of impiety and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devotion? It was that which the Diſciples did, or rather did not do. Hath it any thing in Commune with the Service. of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with that Action by which the Hoſt is lifted up that it may be Adored, with that Worſhip that all the World give to it, by kiſſing the ground at the ſight thereof, with the Cuſtom of carrying it in Pomp about the Streets that it may be Adored. Preſs your Converters, and enquire of them, did the Apoſtles Adore it? If they ſay yea, ask them why they continued ſitting, and why they never ſaid one word of it? If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they did not Adore, ask them why they will conſtrain you to do it? Why do you deſire that we ſhould do more than the Apoſtles?</p>
               <p>And as to the Oblation and Sacrifice, where are they? The Oblation of the Victim cannot be made till after the Tranſubſtantiation, after that the Body of Chriſt is made preſent by Conſecration, after theſe words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Now after theſe words, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt preſented nothing to God, he preſented to his Diſciples, yea he did not pronounce thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> but as he was giving the Bread to his Diſciples. The Oblation therefore is not neceſſary, the Sacrifice is not eſſential, for Chriſt Jeſus did not practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Stay not there. Preſs theſe Doctors to tell you, whether Chriſt Sacrificed himſelf in the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt? You will ſee them perplexed, if they ſay that he Sacrificed himſelf. Ask them why he Sacrificed himſelf upon the Croſs the next day? The firſt Sacrifice of his Body which he made by breaking the Bread, was it not Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for the ſins of the Living and the Dead? Behold then the ſins of Men expiated before his Death, and therefore there was no need of his Death to make
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49990:61"/>that expiation. The Sacrifice of the Maſs is at this day, ſays Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> a Sacrifice of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration.</p>
               <p>Now the Sacrifice which Jeſus Chriſt offered in the firſt: Euchariſt was no Sacrifice of Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for we do not Commemorate a future event, and a thing which is not yet come to paſs, ſo that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which is at this day made, is not the ſame thing with that which was made by Jeſus Chriſt in the firſt Euchariſt. The Sacrifice of the Maſs is the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Fleſh of our Lord bruiſed, and his Blood poured out, but in the firſt Euchariſt the Fleſh of Chriſt was not broken, nor his blood ſpilt. So that Chriſt Sacrificed that which yet was not, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented an Oblation under a relation under which he did not yet ſubſiſt. There be certainly a thouſand ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities in ſaying, that Jeſus Chriſt Sacrificed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the firſt Euchariſt, many Papiſts have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it. If your Converters have as much ſincerity as many of their Doctors have had, to confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt did not Sacrifice in the firſt Euchariſt, demand of them by what right they Sacrifice at this day? For they ought not to do any more than Chriſt did. And he has not commanded them in ſaying <hi>do this,</hi> to do any thing but what he himſelf did. So that if he did not Sacrifice, he hath not commanded them to Sacrifice afterward. Therefore it ought to remain certain, that in the firſt Age the Sacrifice of the Maſs as well as its Ceremonies were intirely unknown.</p>
               <p>As to what appertains to other Sacraments, as is that of Marriage and Penance, he muſt have a mind blinded by prejudice beyond all imagination to believe they may be found in the Scripture. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Penance are indeed found there, but there is not one word which does eſtabliſh them as ſacred Ceremonies deſigned to ſeal the Covenant of Grace,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49990:62"/>and to confer forgiveneſs of ſins. Confirmation is found there, <hi>i. e.</hi> the cuſtom of laying on of hands for the giving the Holy Spirit, and that of Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick to recover them from Diſeaſes. Some of the Proſelytes of theſe Gentlemen make a great buſineſs of it, and have ſaid to us, as a great reproach, that we have taken away Confirmation and Extreme Unction. It is a great pity that minds which ſeem inlightned, ſhould ſtumble at trifles. And is it not clear, that this Impoſition of Hands, and Extreme Unction was deſigned for doing of Miracles, which are long ſince ceaſed? But they ſay that the following Ages did nevertheleſs practiſe it. That we ſhall ſee afterward.</p>
               <p>The Invocation of the Holy Virgin and Saints, the Worſhip of Relicks, Adoring of Images, and the Service of Creatures in Popery, is an affair ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable that it fills almoſt all. Nevertheleſs the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the New Teſtament ſays nothing of it. Nor is it poſſible, that Men well Educated can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves, that theſe are Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we ſee not the leaſt footſteps of them in the Writings of the Apoſtles. It is a blindneſs which cannot be underſtood. As to matter of Fact we can have no diſpute with Papiſts concerning it. They muſt acknowledge that the Apoſtles, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts ſpeak not one word, either of the Invocation of Saints and Angels, nor of the Veneration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, nor of the Adoration of Images. As to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Right, if the Church has power to introduce theſe new Worſhips, let it be proved, and put paſt doubt and Controverſie: for I do affirm that he muſt be ſmitten with a ſpirit of blockiſhneſs, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that we may Religiouſly invoke creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of God, and order of his Apoſtles. Plainly it will be ſaid, that the Apoſtles have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Invocation of Saints; and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49990:62"/>have practiſed it, but they have left nothing written concerning it. I do affirm, that he muſt have a Forehead made of Braſs who ſhall ſay ſuch a thing. And the new Converts, who can be perſuaded of it, make no uſe of their reaſon. It will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the mind of a reaſonable Man, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles have appointed Invocation of Saints, and ſaid nothing of it in their Writings.</p>
               <p>Purgatory, which they would have paſs for a little thing, is nevertheleſs a very great one. For Prayers for the dead, publick and private Maſſes, and almoſt all the <hi>Roman</hi> Worſhip is founded thereon. So that the Holy Spirit could not let it ſlip. If there be a Purgatory, it muſt be in the Scripture, or there is none.. I take it for granted, and 'tis to ſcoff People, to go ſearch this pretended Fire, <hi>in the priſon whence we muſt not go out till we have paid the utmoſt farthing, in the fire that ought to try all things at the end of the world, in the priſon where are the Spirits to which</hi> Noah <hi>preach'd.</hi> If Heaven and Hell were no other ways revealed in the Scripture, the profane would have a fair opportunity to laugh at us.</p>
               <p>The Authority of the Pope is the laſt of thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Popery that I have repreſented. 'Tis an Affair about which there can be no Controverſie, which has any foundation in the World. Ask your Converters where-is the Pope in the Scriptures, they will quote to you the Words of Jeſus Chriſt to S. <hi>Peter, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my church.</hi> Call a Turk, a Jew, or any other Man, that hath common ſenſe, and ask him, whether he ſees therein, that God hath eſtabliſhed a Man at <hi>Rome</hi> with full authority to guide the whole Church, to damn, to ſave, to judge of all Differences, to determine without Appeal, to excommunicate Kings, Princes and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, he will believe you laugh him to ſcorn. The new Converts which ſee therein the Apoſtolick Chair
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49990:63"/>from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh, have very good Eyes.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, my Brethren, take your Converters a little to thoſe Texts of Scripture, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merates the Officers of the Church. He has given ſome to be Paſtors, Teachers, Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Biſhops, Deacons, Elders and Prophets; in thoſe places where he declares the Duties of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Offices of the Church. Preſs them, ſay I, and demand of them, whether they dare ſay, that the Apoſtle hath omitted the firſt of all Offices, an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice alone in its kind infinitely ſuperior to all others. Ask them if they do believe in good earneſt, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared the Duties of Biſhops in general, and that he ſaid nothing for the Regulation of the Biſhop of Biſhops. I am perſuaded, if you preſs them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly thereon, they will bluſh in your Faces.</p>
               <p>Behold, I do maintain, that I have ſaid enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready for the Hiſtory of the firſt Age. The ſilence of the Scripture about all the Articles of Popery is an indiſputable proof, that then it was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. But there is much more, you have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred poſitive Proofs, that then the Chriſtian Religion was wholly oppoſite to Popery. Againſt the Real Preſence you have all thoſe Paſſages where the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is called Bread, and a Commemoration of the Death of our Lord; all thoſe where 'tis ſaid, our Lord is on high, and not here below. Againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſs you have all the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Againſt the Worſhip of Creatures you have the Decalogue, and a thouſand other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments which do appoint, that you adore and invoke God alone. Againſt the taking away the Cup, and the Adoration of the Euchariſt, you have the Hiſtory of its Inſtitution. Againſt Purgatory you have an hundred Texts which tell you, that after this life Believers go to Heaven. Againſt the Pope
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49990:63"/>you have all thoſe places, where our Lord, and the Apoſtles forbid the Domination of Church-Men, both over their Flocks, and one another. This is not a place to engage in a long Controverſie by the Scripture; we compoſe a Hiſtory, not a Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Know therefore hiſtorically, in the following Articles, what was the Primitive Chriſtianity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what was the form of the Apoſtolick Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſtians having as yet no Churches, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled where they could for the Service of God; and it was almoſt always from Houſe to Houſe. This is apparent both in the Hiſtory of the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Aſſemblies they preached, and declared the Word of God. This is alſo certain, and read in divers Texts in the Book of the Acts.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They brake Bread from Houſe to Houſe, the Sacred Scripture ſays ſo expreſly, that is to ſay, they had no Altars, Pattins, Communion-Cloaths, or holy Habits to remove from place to place. The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were celebrated in a perfect Simplicity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Ordinarily the Sacrament was celebrated at or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſober Meals, where Chriſtians came by invitation. About the end of the Meal they brake Bread, preciſely with thoſe Ceremonies which S. <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribes in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sacrament of Baptiſm was alſo adminiſtred with the ſame ſimplicity, they contented themſelves with dipping perſons in Water, with the Invocation of the adorable Trinity. As is ſeen in all the Baptiſms ſpoken of in the Book of the <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It had been an Abomination to have ſeen Images. And thoſe which have the confidence to ſhew at this day Images, as made by S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and from the time of the Apoſtles, are impudent beyond all imagination. Altho theſe Images ſhould be things indifferent in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, how is it that the Apoſtles ſhould ſcandalize
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49990:64"/>the Jews, who had Images in that horror, that they broke in pieces the Enſigns of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. How is it, that the Jews, which ſought pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt S. <hi>Paul</hi> to deſtroy him, as an Apoſtate, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later of the Law, never objected to him, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Images to be adored?</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the Holy Places there was no Altar, but to conſecrate, and communicate they ſerv'd themſelves of the firſt Table that came to hand, they ſprinkled no Holy Water on thoſe that entered their Churches, they made no Sign of the Croſs in the Celebration of the Myſteries.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They ſpake and Preached in a Language under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all the world; they officiated in <hi>Greek</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Greece,</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all the Weſt to every one according to their Language.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They gave the Communion to all under both kinds.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Celebration without Communicants was a thing altogether unknown; for the Euchariſt was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Supper or common Meal. Now a Meal where one Man drinks and eats alone was never called a Supper, or common Repaſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Paſtors were equal amongſt themſelves. Not to enter into the Controverſie about the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Biſhop and a Presbyter, which is not at all neceſſary for you. It is certain, that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of different Churches were all equal among themſelves.</p>
               <p>If we falſifie in any of theſe Articles, your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters ſhall do well to ſhame us; but they will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do it by Holy Scripture. For they and you muſt remember, that we are upon the Hiſtory, and that we follow the Ages in their order; and ſo it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that in the firſt Age they ſhew us all by the Writers of that Age, which are the Apoſtles and their Diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49990:64"/>
Seeing it is not at all in our Deſign to make a Treatiſe of Controverſie upon the firſt Age, no more than on thoſe that follow, this is ſufficient for its Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and we muſt paſs to the ſecond. But foraſmuch as we cannot, at the preſent, go very far in the ſecond Age, we will delay the Hiſtory thereof to a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letter, and we will finiſh this with ſome Letters of our Confeſſors, where you will ſee the Character of true Chriſtianity, and Martyrs; you have already ſeen one Letter of a famous Confeſſor, behold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame Author. You will underſtand the Lovelineſs of this ſecond Letter the better by reading that which was the occaſion thereof, which was an Anſwer to the firſt. And therefore you ſhall have them both here.</p>

                           <hi>May</hi> 27, 1686.</date> To our Dear Brother Monſieur <hi>de M—</hi> Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt, condemned to the Gallies at the <hi>Tournelle.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>I Have received your Letter, my dear Brother, dated from the <hi>Tournelle.</hi> It hath cauſed me more joy than if I had received one from the Pallace at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> or <hi>Louvre,</hi> written by the Hand of the greateſt King in the World. You do me much greater Honor than I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to chuſe me to whom you may impart the glorious advantages that God beſtows upon you. Another, it may be, would anſwer by condoling, and complaining of the Evils that you ſuffer. But as for me, God forbid, that I ſhould look upon you as unhappy. Your ſtate is worthy of Envy, your Chains are heavy, and your Irons ſhameful, according to the opinion of the world; and if you bore them with any other Spirit than you do, I ſhould complain
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49990:65"/>thereof. But with the Courage and Piety, which you ſeem to me to have, I do not believe, that there is a perſon in the world more happy, and more glorious. The Yoke of Chriſt is heavy to the Men of the World which are weak; but it is ſweet and eaſie to faithful Souls that bear it with patience. Your Sentiments and Diſpoſitions are Chriſtian, my dear Brother, and worthy of emulation, but beware of one thing, that is Pride. If you continue this glorious Work as you have begun it, your name will be put in the Catalogue of holy Martyrs, whoſe names yet live laden with Bleſſings. God will diſtinguiſh you in his Rewards, you ſhall be with Jeſus Chriſt amongſt the firſt raiſed from the dead, which ſhall judge others. But attribute the Courage that you have to the Grace of God, which works this great Work in you, ſo worthy of admiration. Alas, we have ſeen pillars broken by the wind of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Men fall unhappily, which we had called the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Martyrs, but which have been found Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to <hi>Peter,</hi> who through weakneſs denyed his Maſter. Who is it that hath ſuſtained you among ſo many Falls, but the Hand of the Almighty God, who ſupports whom he pleaſeth, and permits to fall whom he will by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unſearchableneſs of his Judgments? What an Honor is it, my dear Brother, to have been willing to chuſe you, and make you an example of that holy perſeverance which is ſo rare at this day. Be of good courage in the name of our great God, and moſt compaſſionate Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and remember, my dear Brother, that you ſuffer for him who ſuffered for you, and render to him that which you have received from him. Remember that the loving Saviour offers you a Crown at the end of you Race, and that he ſays to you, Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt be of good courage, <hi>Fight the good fight, he which overcomes, I will cauſe to ſit down on my throne, as I alſo have overcome, and am ſet down with my father in his throne.</hi> Remember, that the Angels, are at preſent, Spectators of your Combat, that they wait the iſſue, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49990:65"/>that they prepare a place for your holy Soul in their holy Society. Either you will continue in theſe Torments, or you will ſurmount and eſcape them. If this laſt happens, as I very much hope, how glorious will you be among your Brethren! You will have right to ſay as <hi>S. Paul, Let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks, and ſcars of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> We ſhall kiſs your wounds, and we ſhall behold you with envy and admiration. If you loſe your life in your ſlavery and pains, God will prepare for you in the Heavens a Glory diſtinct from others; for you muſt believe the Crown of Martyrs is more rich, and illuſtrious than that of ordinary Believers. Say them, <hi>All things well conſidered, this light and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Affliction is not worthy to be compared to the Glory which is to come, and which ſhall be revealed in me.</hi> Would to God I could depaint before you the Glory of Heaven, the Joy of Souls which ſee God and poſſeſs him, the Satisfaction of the Bleſſed, which are plunged in an Ocean of Delights, the Tranſports of Saints, which embrace their Divine Saviour, which are in the glorious Society of the Patriarchs, which ſing the Praiſes of God with Angels, and are full of Joy, which exceeds all underſtanding! In the name of God, dear Brother, lift up your eyes that way, and let that grand object ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you.</p>
                     <p>Take heed of the perilous Temptations, to which the World, and your own Heart may expoſe you. <hi>1.</hi> Your Heart may peradventure ſay, the Difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion and mine is ſo little, that 'tis not worth the while to ſuffer Martyrdom for it. Say thereon, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me. Rome</hi> is that ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> concerning which, God has ſaid, <hi>Go out of her my people.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Court trod under foot by the Gentiles for the ſpace of twelve hundred and ſixty days.</hi> The Papiſts are the Gentiles, which tread under foot the Church of God, and oppreſs it; their Images are the Idols of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49990:66"/>ancient Pagans, and their Saints are in the place of the falſe Gods of Antiquity. The Sacrament which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to be adored, is an Idol which cannot be adored, without ſtirring up the holy Jealouſie of the true Jeſus Chriſt. Remember, my dear Brother, that our Truths are not leſs important than they were an hundred and fifty years ago, when our Fathers went joyfully to death, in defence of them. They deſerved that they ſhould die for them then, they deſerve that we ſhould ſuffer for them at this day.</p>
                     <p>Take head of another very grievous Temptation. Your Heart will ſay, What, muſt I condemn to Hell all thoſe perſons that have fallen through weakneſs, which go to Maſs by conſtraint? Without doubt God will ſhew them mercy, and ſave them. He will do the ſame by me, I will follow their example, I ſhall have the ſame lot with them. To that, remember the Precept of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Judge not that ye be not judged.</hi> Leave the Brethren that are fallen to the Judgment of God. We do hope that God will ſhew them mercy, that is to ſay, that he will give them Repentance of their great fault; but in the name of God, be not tempted to imitate them. Is it not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the ſtate in which they are, is at leaſt doubtful? And is not yours certain? Will it not be then a madneſs to quit a ſtate, and way which certainly leads you to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory of Paradiſe, to put your ſelf in a way which may lead you to ruine and damnation; this is the beſt that you can think of it. Moreover, my dear Brother, you ought to remember, that where much hath been given, much will be required, the Favours which God hath beſtowed upon you hitherto are ſo great, that you can never make ſufficient acknowledgments for them. He hath given you a courage and reſolution that hath few Examples. Oh! how precious is the Talent that you have received? But alſo how faulty will your lazineſs be if you go dig and hide it? When a perſon falls at the beginning of his Race, it will be ſaid he was not fit for ſo long a Courſe, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49990:66"/>Men will excuſe him. But if he run vigorouſly within two ſteps of the end, and having his hand already upon the Crown, lets it go, and loſes it, all Men will blame him, and treat him as wretched, and ſloathful. <hi>Run you therefore the race that is ſet before you with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and perſeverance, ſeeing you are encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſo great a Cloud of Witneſſes.</hi> Look to that Cloud of holy Martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt, which have gone before you, which have been Burnt, Tortured, torn with Pincers, ſometimes whole years together, which have ſeen their Bowels fall out in the Fire before they gave up the Ghoſt. The Chain which you wear about your neck is fifty pounds, but it is more ſupportable than flames of Fire. Say therefore, <hi>We have not yet reſiſted unto blood fighting againſt ſin.</hi> How glorious is the Chain that you bear about your neck! It is more precious than if it were of Gold and Diamonds. Being coloured with your ſweat, and ſometimes with your blood, it may one day prove, (if it pleaſes God) the moſt precious of your movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and you will ſay, behold there the Carcanet, and Collar that my Divine Spouſe hath given me. Behold the Nuptial Jewel wherewith he hath honoured me. He hath done me the honor to make me conformable to him in his Sufferings, that I may be conformable to him in his Glory.</p>
                     <p>In the name of God, my dear Brother, do not ſuffer your ſelf to be ſoftned by the memory of your Wife and Children. God who is rich in Mercy, the Father of the Fatherleſs, and Husband of the Widow, will take care of her and them, and not leave them without all Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that loves Father or Mother, Wife or Children, more than me, is not worthy of me. We ought not to love any thing but God, and for the love of God, this good God will be to us in the ſtead of all things, and will comfort us effectually. The moment of time in which you leave the Priſon, to go to the Galleys, to which you are deſigned, will be a terrible moment to you; but in the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49990:67"/>name of God fortifie your ſelf againſt the horrors of it, and ſay, I follow Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, he went forth of the Judgment-Hall bearing his Croſs, and I go out of my Priſon bearing my Chains. I ſhall arrive at my Calvary, but I ſhall alſo arrive at the Mount of Olives, at the Mountain, of Peace, and at laſt I ſhall aſcend up into Heaven to my God, and dear Redeemer. In your Journey you will bear your Chain by the Roads, but it will ſparkle with glory, and whereas the ſhame and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy wherewithal Galley-Slaves are laden, is uſually the heavieſt part of their burthen, on the contrary you will be laden with glory, and your Enemies themſelves will admire you. I praiſe God for the moderation with which you ſpeak of your Perſecutors, therein I obſerve a proof that you are a true Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt. Continue to bleſs, and pray to God for them. When Men ſuffer for an ill Cauſe, it is always with impatience, and fury againſt thoſe that are the cauſe thereof. But the true Religion inſpires this ſpirit of ſweetneſs and kindneſs. So that without going further than your own Heart, you may there find evidences of the truth of the Religion that you defend. Call to mind our glorious Anceſtors, and their Sufferings, and ſay, they were not Fools, and deſperate perſons, when they ſufiered for the ſame Truths that I defend. On the contrary, they were full of Piety, good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Zeal. I will therefore imitate them, and not be troubled at the Judgment that the Men of the World ſhall make concerning it. Endeavour to get a Bible, or a New Teſtament, it matters not what Tranſlation it be, it will be always ſufficient for your Conſolation. If this Letter come to your hands, inform me, if poſſible, where your dear Wife is, to the end that I may comfort her. She it a good Woman, and I have always eſteemed and loved her, and I hope God will have pity on her. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel my dear Brother. Mademoiſelle de P— your Siſter, is well. I communicated to her your Letter for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. Do not fear leſt we ſhould forget you in our
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49990:67"/>Prayers. Do not forget us in yours. Pray to God to preſerve this ſmall Country, in which there are ſo many of his Children. Your Prayers proceeding out of Irons will be more effectual than ours. The Grace of our Lord Jeſus be with you. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <head>From the <hi>Tournelle, July</hi> 2. 1687.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Have received that which you did me the honor to write, it hath been a great Conſolation to me, and I did not expect leſs from ſo faithful a ſervant of God as you are. It hath not only edified and confirmed me, but it may produce the ſame effect upon ſome few others to whom we have thought fit to communicate it. I have not the ſatisfaction to read it, as often as I have deſired, and do yet deſire. I have not read, it but in ſecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the difficulty of getting any thing from abroad without the knowledge of our Guards. I return you thanks for the care you have had of repreſenting ſo much to the life, what I ought to fear, and hope, in the condition and ſtate wherein I am. I had already formed to my ſelf Ideas ſufficiently clear of thoſe things, and thanks be to God, your good advice hath impreſſed them more ſtrongly upon my Heart, ſo that I have reaſon to hope, that with help from on high, God will finiſh that good Work that he hath begun in me, and that my Sufferings ſhall end in his Glory, my own Salvation, and the Edification of my Brethren. When I make reflection upon the merciful conduct, of God towards me, I am raviſhed in admiration thereof, and cannot find words ſufficient to teſtifie my ſenſe of them, and my acknowledgment for them. There are few Prayers that I make which are not accompanyed with tears of joy, when I make mention of them. As ſoon as our Churches were ſhut up in the Province where I lived, and that pretious liberty loſt, which now we
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49990:68"/>breath after, God put it into my Heart to go and ſearch it at <hi>Lixim,</hi> where yet they did enjoy it, and a few days after we were deprived of it there, as well as elſewhere; without ſtaggering I put my ſelf to find it among Strangers, forſaking with courage and joy, all the accommodations of Life which we enjoyed in <hi>France.</hi> In theſe Travels, and in the different Priſons, and Dungeons, through which the providence of God led me, I have been preſerved from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temptations, which have made almoſt all our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren fall, and which would not have failed to have born me down with the firſt. For the impriſonments that I have ſuffered this day ſeven months compleat, are a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in compariſon of thoſe terrible tryals, and nevertheleſs I have not been without giving ſome marks of my weakneſs. The tears of a Wife, and Family which are dear to me, and which could not ſhake me at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> joyned to thoſe of two Brother-in-Laws, which came to ſee me at <hi>Chalons,</hi> prevailed with me to accept certain propoſitions, which were made to me by two perſons the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable of that Province; but a few days after God having ſhewed me my fault, and preſented me an occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it, I embraced it with Zeal, Joy, and Tears, and the Father of Mercies, that knows how to bring light out of darkneſs, made uſe of my infirmities to give me that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and firmneſs that I have had ever ſince. This gives me ground to hope that he will continue this favour to me to the end, and that he will always proportion his Gifts and Graces to the tryals whereunto he ſhall pleaſe to expoſe me; for that which was done not being executed, other offers were afterwards made unto me, which touched me leſs than the former, and I rejected them without any delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherewithal they were ſo provoked, that on the morrow I was put in the Dungeon. Thirteen days before my Condemnation, being in the Priſon at <hi>Paris,</hi> one of my friends, Tutor to the Children of the King, and Madam <hi>de Morteſpan,</hi> with his Majeſties leave came to see me; he propoſed to me, that I ſhould go eight or ten months to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49990:68"/>the Biſhop <hi>de Meaux</hi> to be inſtructed (ſo they ſpeak here.) I ſoon returned him thanks, and aſſured him, that time was not capable of changing my Illuminations and Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that I did believe, that Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> would give me no more ſatisfaction than other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks that I had ſeen. It is about eight days ſince that M. <hi>Morel le Riche Partiſan</hi> ſent me word, that he would take me out of my Chains on the morrow, if I would take time, and that undetermined, faithfully to imploy for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uction, and did aſſure me, that the promiſe that ſhould be made me ſhould be faithfully obſerved. 'Twas <hi>Le —</hi> which ſpake to me in his Name. I prayed him to go quickly and tell M. <hi>Morel,</hi> that I was ſenſibly affected with the kindneſs that he teſtified towards me, and that I made him all the acknowledgments imaginable, and gave him my humble thanks; but I was reſolved to expiate my fault, by ſuffering the penalties to which I was condemned. I give you this particular account of things M. that you may know the Diſpoſition of my Soul. The manner after which I ſuffer, and the bright ſide on which God cauſes me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all my Evils, perſuade me, that he will do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be faithful to him even to the death. I do not fix my conſideration on the eſtate; in which I am, which is much more uneaſie to all thoſe that ſee it, than to my ſelf. I carry it only to thoſe Recompences that God has promiſed to thoſe that fear his Name. I am certain that the light Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions wherewithal he is pleaſed to viſit me, will produce in me, according to his promiſes, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory. I comfort my ſelf on this, that the Sufferings of the preſent time are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
                     <p>I aſſure my ſelf of what S. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Bleſſed is he that endureth temptation when he is tryed, for he ſhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe that love him.</hi> I rejoyce in this, that our Saviour declares them happy that ſuffer for Righteouſneſs ſake. M. I make all my Glory and all my happineſs to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49990:69"/>conſiſt in this, that my Saviour has not thought me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name. I ſupport my ſelf on the Rock of Ages, I put my whole truſt in him, I expect no ſuccour or aſſiſtance but from him alone. Upon a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſolid, I promiſe my ſelf that nothing ſhall be able to ſhake me, at preſent he makes me feel the effects of a ſingular goodneſs, in the midſt of wicked Paſſengers, which it pleaſes him that I ſuffer, he makes me to taſt the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of true and ſolid good, he fills my ſoul with that joy unſpeakable and glorious, which ſurpaſſes all underſtanding, he fills me with that hope by which he hath ſuſtained all the happy Confeſſors of his Truth, and by which I hope he will ſuſtain me, as well as they. My principal ſtudy is to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf from Earth, to conceive a diſguſt for the World, and an ardent deſire for Heaven. This, Monſieur, is my ordinary imployment, as far as the infamous place where I am impriſoned will permit it. I call it infamous, becauſe one never hears an honeſt word there, all rings and ſounds again with filthineſs and execrable Blaſphemies. There is ſuch a noiſe for the moſt part night and day, that I have ſcarcely found heretofore one happy moment to lift up my Heart to God. I have been ſo oppreſſed with ſleep that I have oftentimes fell under it before I finiſhed my Prayers, when I awake at three or four in the morning, I indeavour to ſleep no more, to the end that whilſt we are a little at roſt, I may with ſome attention perform my Devotions to God. I have had more liberty for ten or twelve days, for when the weather is fair they let the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners go forth, and keep them in a Court all the day, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be ſix which they keep incloſed. I imploy one part of this time in Reading, Meditation, and Prayer, and I take the liberty to ſing ſome Pſalms, as I have done in all the places of my Captivity, and no body hath complained thereof. Behold in two words an abridgment of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. We lie three and fifty of us in a place which is not above five fathom in length, and one and a half in breadth. There lies on my right side a Countryman ſick,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49990:69"/>with his Head at my feet, and his Feet at my Head, and ſo it is with others. There is not it may be one among us, which do not envy the condition of many Dogs and Horſes. This makes us all wiſh that the Priſoners may ſoon depart, but that is a ſecret that muſt not be told us; but as far as we can judge, they will depart the next week. There were <hi>95</hi> of us yeſterday condemned, but there dyed two on that day, and one on this, and we have yet <hi>15</hi> or <hi>16</hi> ſick, and there be few eſcape. I have had five fits of a Tertian Ague, but God bethanked I am very well recovered, and prepared to take my Journey to <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> We shall take in <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſome of our Brethren, which are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the ſame reaſon with my ſelf, who am the firſt that have had the honor to be Condemned by the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> There remains no more, Monſieur, but that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to me the aſſiſtance of your Holy Prayers. I deſire the ſame favour of Mademoiſelle your Wife, whom (with your leave) I do here aſſure of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Obtain for me, if you pleaſe, the ſame advantage from thoſe <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of your acquaintance, which God doth admit to your Holy Aſſemblies. Monſieur <hi>M—</hi> arrived yeſterday, but I have not yet had the honor to ſee him. Not having the liberty to write to my Siſter, nor my Nephew her Son, I muſt be content here to give them my Salutations. I do not write this, but in great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty whether it can go hence. If your great imployment will permit you to give ſome Conſolation to my Wife and Children, as you have made me hope, and ſhe expects with a great deal of joy, I intreat you do it. You may well imagin that our ſeparation will be a thing terrible to us all, and above all to her. Before I received your Letter, I did nor forget in my Prayers thoſe things which you recommended to me. I pray God encompaſs you about with his protection, and preſerve you many years to labour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably in his Vineyard.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Soviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHereas many things worthy of your Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and proper to nouriſh your Piety, have been communicated to us by many of our Brethren, we have been tempted (for a few months) to communicate them to you at this time. But in concluſion we have choſen to ſatisfie the impatience of thoſe, which are willing to ſee what we have to teach them, concerning the Chriſtianity of the ſecond Age. We remit therefore to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters, that which we do not do in this, and we do promiſe thoſe that have ſent us any Memorials touching our Martyrs and Confeſſors, to enter them afterward in this Work, according as we ſhall find place and occaſion therein.</p>

               <head>The ſecond Age of the Church.</head>
               <p>WE muſt conſider, firſt of all, the manner wherein they did Celebrate the Sacraments, and thereby we ſhall learn what Opinion they had of them.</p>
               <p>They were Celebrated as yet with great Simplicity in the ſecond Age. Behold that which <hi>Juſtin</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr ſays, concerning the manner of Adminiſtring Baptiſm. <hi>We will here Expound after what manner we Dedicate our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, fearing leſt if we paſs over any thing concerning it, we ſhould be ſuſpected of malignity and diſſimulation. All thoſe therefore, which are perſuaded of the truth of our Doctrine, and promiſe to live according to our Rules and Laws, are commanded to Pray, to Faſt, and beg the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and we Pray and Faſt with them. After that we lead them to a place where there is Water, and we Regenerate them after the ſame manner which we our ſelves were Regenerated: for we Waſh, or Baptiſe them in the Name of the Author of all things, of the Lord God, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Hitherunto we ſee nothing changed from the Apoſtolick Form. There is neither ſign of the Croſs, nor Exorciſm, nor Salt, nor Spittle, nor nothing of that, which is at this day practiſed in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Behold after what manner the Myſtery of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was Celebrated in the ſame Age, according to the Teſtimony of the ſame Author, and in the ſame place. <hi>After,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we have Baptiſed after the ſame manner, him that doth believe, we conduct him to the place where are thoſe Believers that are called Brethren, which are aſſembled on purpoſe to Pray earneſtly to God, both for themſelves, and for him that hath been illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated or Baptiſed, and for all others in all places, to the end that we may be worthy to be found Diſciples to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49990:71"/>Truth, and Obſervers of thoſe things that are commanded, and to converſe in all good Works, for the obtaining of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation. When Prayers are ended, we mutually Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute each other by a Kiſs. After that they preſent to him of the Brethren which doth preſide, Bread, and a Cup of Wine mingled with Water: he takes it, and pronounces over it praiſes to the Father of all things, in the Name of the Son, and by the Holy Spirit. Afterwards he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges much in Praiſes, for that it hath pleaſed him to give us theſe things. And when he hath finiſhed his Prayers, and Praiſes, the people that are preſent, concur by their acclamations, ſaying</hi> Amen. <hi>Now</hi> Amen <hi>in the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Language ſignifies ſo be it. When the Preſident hath finiſhed his Praiſes, and Thankſgivings, and the people have ſaid</hi> Amen, <hi>thoſe which amongſt our ſelves we call Deacons, diſtribute to every one, that are preſent, of this Bread that hath been bleſt, and of this Wine and Water, and they carry thereof to the abſent. And this Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called among us the Euchariſt. It is not permitted to any one to eat thereof, unleſs he receive our Doctrine as true, and hath been partaker in the waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for the remiſſion of ſins, and lives according to the appointment, and Laws of Chriſt Jeſus. To conclude, we do not receive this Bread as common Bread, nor this Drink as common Drink. But as by the word of God Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour was made Fleſh, and took Fleſh and Blood for our Salvation: So we have been taught that this Aliment upon which have been pronounced Praiſes and Thankſgivings, are the Fleſh and Blood of that Jeſus that was made Fleſh.</hi> Behold what was the Worſhip of the Ancients, and the Ceremonies with which they Celebrated their Myſteries.

4. The place was ſeparate, becauſe then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was performed by immerſion, and that they might not expoſe the Nakedneſs of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the view of other Believers.</item>
                     <item>5. He that was Baptiſed, was plunged in the Water, and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced over him the Invocation of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>i.e.</hi> they Baptiſed him in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</item>
                     <item>6. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they brought him back to the full Aſſembly, and there he was gathered, and received into the number of the Faithful.</item>
                     <item>7. All the Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their Prayers, in which they Prayed for the Church, for the perſon Baptiſed, for the Powers in general, and in particular.</item>
                     <item>8. When Prayers were ended, they prepared themſelves for the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a Kiſs of Charity, which they mutually gave each other.</item>
                     <item>9. They preſented to the Preſident, and to him that had Prayed, common Bread, made after the ordinary manner, and a Cup in which there was Wine mingled with Water.</item>

                     <item>11. He adds ſome Prayers, and Thankſgivings to God, that he hath been pleaſed to give to us the pretious Gift of the Fleſh, and Blood, of his Son at the Holy Table.</item>

                     <item>2. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

                  </list> It doth not appear that this was Practiſed in the firſt Age. Theſe are indeed ſmall changes, but nevertheleſs they ought to be obſerved, for the better knowledge of thoſe that followed. But on the other ſide obſerve that we ſee not here,

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>We Conjure you, my Brethren, to give attention to all this, and ſo if there be any thing therein that hath the leaſt taſt, or ſavour of Sacrifice. What a prodigious change muſt have happened ſince that time, to compoſe and frame ſuch a Worſhip as they call the Maſs, where a Prieſt covered with extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Garments, (which they ſay are Myſterious) heaps one upon another, in a Language that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not underſtand, a multitude of Prayers, ſome good, and ſome bad, all without order, and without reaſon, make Oblations, ſigns of the Croſs, Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where the people Adore, and Proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Sacrament when it is lifted up, where the Prieſt eats alone, after he hath made a hundred Ceremonies on the Bread and Wine, Ceremonies that ſignifie nothing, but render the Celebration of the Myſtery ridiculous. Do not inſiſt pertinaciouſly on what remains, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr calls
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49990:72"/>the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt Jeſus. So we call them our ſelves, and ſo have the Writers of all Ages called them. So our Lord Jeſus, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them. And it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more in <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> than thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>This bread is my body, this cup is my blood. Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who lived in the ſame Age with <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> acknowledges, that 'tis a Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, not a Tranſmutation. <hi>When Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſaid, This is my body, he called his Body Bread, which is made of many Grains. 'Tis not common Bread,</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſtin Martyr, 'tis the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But 'tis ſuch Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Fleſh and Blood, according to him. That is to ſay, which is changed into our bodily Nouriſhment, and paſſes through our Veins. Now no Man ever believed, or can believe, that the true Fleſh of Chriſt paſſes into the Nouriſhment of our Members. The ſame <hi>Juſtin</hi> which calls the Euchariſt <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> calls it <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after the Conſecration, and at the time of the Diſtribution. <hi>They give,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to all thoſe that are preſent, Bread and Wine,</hi> over which Praiſes and Thankſgivings have been made. Becauſe he hath ſaid, that <hi>'tis not common Bread,</hi> we muſt not conclude, that 'tis not Bread at all, if it be not thought fit, that we ſay a great Man is no Man, becauſe it hath been ſaid, that he is no ordinary or common Man.</p>
               <p>I muſt alſo give you notice in this place, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that you beware of a ſnare, that they compoſe or make of ſeveral Paſſages of the Fathers of this Age, where they make you read the words <hi>Altar, Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> on the Subject of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and by theſe Words and Terms, they endeavour to perſwade you, that the Sacrifice of the Maſs was then known. The word Altar is not found in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the ſecond Age, whoſe Writings are indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49990:73"/>'Tis found in the Canons attributed to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and in the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> But 'tis known, that their Writings are not owned by all the World. Nevertheleſs I am inclined to believe, that from that time they called the Table of the Euchariſt Altar. For why ſhould they make any ſcruple of uſing the word Altar, ſeeing they made uſe of the words Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sacrifice when they ſpake of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>But you muſt know,

                     <item>1. That 'twas an Innovation in the Terms, and that in the Writings of the Apoſtles, you never find the words Altar, Oblation or Sacrifice on that Subject. Read the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Euchariſt, the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> where the <hi>breaking of bread</hi> is often ſpoken of, that is, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament of the Supper. Read the tenth and eleventh Chapters of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where much is ſaid of this Sacrament; you do not ſee theſe Terms there.</item>
                     <item>2. You muſt know, that theſe terms Altar, Oblation and Sacrifice took their originals from the cuſtom that Chriſtians had in thoſe times of bringing their Offerings of Bread and Wine, and other things neceſſary for the Service of the Church, and the maintenance of its Paſtors, and ſetting them as an Offering to God on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Table. Yea, they offered them to God by certain Prayers, the Forms whereof are ſtill found in the ancient Liturgies.</item>
                     <item>3 To conclude, you ought to hold for certain, that theſe Oblations, theſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list> of the ſecond Age, had no relation to the conſecrated Signs or Elements. For no Oblation was made to God of the Signs or Elements of Bread, or Wine after their Conſecration. Obſerve that in the paſſage of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Conſecration of Bread and Wine, the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution was made, and no Oblation between them. And for an undoubted proof thereof, obſerve, that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49990:73"/>they are the Believers that make theſe Oblations, and not the Prieſts alone. Hear S. <hi>Clement Romanus,</hi> the Diſciple and Companion of S. <hi>Paul: Thoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who make their Oblations at appointed times are acceptable, and happy; for in following the Commandments of God they commit no ſin.</hi> By this we do not intend to affirm, that afterwards the Prieſt don't bleſs theſe Oblations, and preſent them to God. But learn from S. <hi>Ireneus</hi> what's underſtood by theſe Oblations, and what they were: <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hath given advice to his Diſciples to offer to God the firſt Fruits of his Creatures, not that he hath any need of them, with reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to the end they might not appear with reſpect to themſelves, ungrateful and unfruitful, he took Bread, which is a Creature, and gave thanks thereon, ſaying,</hi> This is my body, <hi>&amp;c. And he hath taught us a new Oblation of the New Teſtament, which the Church receiving from the Apoſtles, offer, as the firſt Fruits of his Gifts to God, which gives us food and nouriſhment.</hi> You very well ſee, that the Church offers not Jeſus Chriſt the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to God, but Bread which is the firſt Fruits of his Creation. You ſee well that this Oblation is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God as a Thankſgiving, becauſe he has given us the Nouriſhments of Bread and Wine, and not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated Bread, for a propitiatory Sacrifice. Hear how he ſpeaks yet of theſe Oblations: <hi>They are not Sacrifices, that ſanctifie the Man, but it is the Conſcience of him that offers, ſanctifies the Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſeeing then that the Church offers with ſimplicity, 'tis but Juſtice that its Oblation paſs for a pure Sacrifice before God.</hi> Behold an undoubted Blaſphemy, according to the Principles of Popery. The Euchariſt is a Sacrifice, but the Sacrifice of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt doth not ſanctifie the Man: on the contrary, 'tis the Conſcience of him that offers, who ſanctifies the Sacrifice of the Body of our Lord in the Maſs. There is, ſay I, a Blaſphemy in all ſhapes and forms. Acknowledge therefore, that nothing is
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49990:74"/>debated there, but the Offerings that Believers ſet upon the holy Table. And that ye may have a perfect knowledge of what was then done in the Celebration of the holy Supper; add from S. <hi>Clement</hi> and S. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> that which was wanting in S. <hi>Juſtin:</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. 'Tis the Believers brought Bread, Wine, Wax, Oil and other things neceſſary in the Church. And as for Fruits and Animals, Apples and Pulſe neceſſary for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of life, they carried them to the Biſhops Houſe.</item>
                     <item>2. Theſe things ſet upon the Table were conſecrated to God by Prayer.</item>
                     <item>3. Of the Bread and Wine which had been thus offered, they took one part for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, and the reſt was ſpent by the Miniſters of the Church, and divided among them for their ſupport and maintenance.</item>
                  </list> Behold the only Oblation that was then made, and 'tis nothing: nevertheleſs from thence is come an Innovation in the Terms, and from thence inſenſibly is come the Sacrifice of the Maſs. Behold the meaning of the third, the fourth and the fifth Canons attributed to the Apoſtles. The third forbids, that they preſent upon the Altar Hony, Milk, Birds, Beaſts and Pulſe. The ſecond permits to offer Ears of Corn, Raiſins, Oil for the Lights, and Incenſe. And the fifth ordains, that they carry their Fruits to the Biſhops, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to be diſtributed among them, and their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons. In the Margin of theſe Canons the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors ſet theſe Words, <hi>The Sacrifice of the Maſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by our Lord.</hi> What ſhameleſs Foreheads have they? Do Men ſacrifice Oil, and Incenſe in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Age, where we now are, nothing is found of that which is called Confirmation, which is one of the Popiſh Sacraments. But it doth not appear, that the Primitive Chriſtians, even to the end of the ſecond Age, did employ any Unction for the giving the Holy Spirit, and for the Confirmation
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49990:74"/>of thoſe that had been baptiſed. 'Tis true, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Hands on thoſe that were baptiſed, both before their Baptiſm, and it may be after. But it is ridiculous to make a Sacrament of this Impoſition of Hands. Concerning which, my Brethren, you ought to know,
<list>
                     <item>1. That Impoſition of Hands is a Ceremony deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Jews; our Lord approved and practiſed it; for which reaſon he laid hands on all the Children they brought to him, when he bleſſed them.</item>
                     <item>2. You ought to be advertiſed, that Impoſition of Hands was an Appendage of Prayer, and that they ſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that Ceremony, as often as they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the extraordinary aſſiſtance of God upon any one.</item>
                  </list> When any one was ſick, they prayed and laid their hands on them. When any one was reconciled to the Church, they begged of God pardon of ſins for him, laying their hands on him. When any one was admitted to a publick Office, they prayed to obtain that aſſiſtance that was neceſſary for him, and laid on him their hands. When they ſent any one upon a difficult Commiſſion, they laid hands on him, and prayed, as may be ſeen in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>The fathers after they had faſted and prayed, laid hands on Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas;</hi> to the end they might go preach the Goſpel amongſt the Gentiles. They were already Presbyters, and had received Miſſion from God and the Church. When they married, they received alſo Prayer, and the Benediction of the Church with Impoſition of Hands annex'd unto it. 'Tis a prodigious Blindneſs, to make of theſe differing Impoſitions of Hands, ſo many Sacraments. I ſhould as ſoon chuſe, or rather ſooner chuſe, to make of theſe differing Prayers, which were made on ſundry occaſions, ſo many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. For 'tis certain, that Prayer over the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the penitent, the ſick, thoſe that took Office, thoſe that were ſent on Commiſſion, thoſe that were married, was the chief of the Action, and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49990:75"/>of Hands was but a decent Geſture and a Rite; which ſignified, that they deſired the Grace of God and his aſſiſtance on the perſon that was concerned therein. 'Tis a pityful thing, that Men lay hold alway on the Skin, and meddle not with the Marrow, and if the principal Action be accompanied with ſome little Ceremony, which is but acceſſory, the love of that which is external, and eaſie to practiſe, preſently changes the principal into acceſſory, and the acceſſory into principal. Bowing the Knee and Impoſition of Hands are two Rites of the ſame kind, and of the ſame neceſſity. To bend the Knee, and lift up the Hands, have been two ſigns, which almoſt always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied Prayer, the firſt ſignifies the Humiliation of the Spirit; the ſecond the Elevation of the Heart; and when this Elevation of the Hands is made on the Head of any one, 'tis to ſignifie, that the Heart lifts up it ſelf according to the deſire, and intention of him, over whom they lift up their hands. Behold the whole Myſtery of this Ceremony, whereof they have made four or five Sacraments. And 'tis the firſt original of the Sacrament of Confirmation, of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of Marriage, of Orders, and of Extreme Unction. If the Humor of Popery and Superſtition had turn'd on the other hand, we had had, it may be, fourteen Sacraments inſtead of ſeven. For of the Genuflection, which is made in praying for the whole and ſound, of that which is made in praying for the ſick, for hardened Sinners, and for thoſe that are penitent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of theſe Genuflections, ſay I, they might have made as many Sacraments with as much reaſon as they have made five Sacraments of the five Orders of Prayers, to which Impoſition of Hands has been annexed. Let this ſerve, my Brethren, to make you underſtand, that nothing is more abſurd, that to make a Sacrament of Confirmation, becauſe in the firſt and ſecond Age they laid hands on thoſe which had been
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49990:75"/>baptiſed. The Apoſtles practiſed it alſo becauſe they had power to obtain the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt for thoſe which had received Baptiſm. The Biſhops affirming themſelves Succeſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, appropriated to themſelves afterward a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which became vain and empty, becauſe they had not the power to cauſe the Holy Ghoſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon thoſe on whom they laid hands. Jeſus Chriſt laid hands not only on Children brought to him, but alſo on the ſick, as it appears in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 6.5.8.13.</note>, and that of S. <hi>Luke</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 4.40.</note>. When he healed the Woman that had been bowed together during the ſpace of eighteen years, he alſo<note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13.</note> laid his Hands upon her. When<note n="*" place="margin">

When S. <hi>Paul</hi> would heal the Father of <hi>Publius,</hi> Prince of <hi>Malta,</hi> of his Fever and Bloody Flux, he laid his hands on him. To conclude, a Man muſt have a Spirit prejudiced beyond all that can be imagined, not to ſee, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands is a ſimple Ceremony annexed to Prayer.</p>
               <p>Concerning Extreme Unction, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Ceremony of anointing the dying to obtain for them Vigor and Strength, neceſſary to overcome death; 'tis that whereof there is not found the leaſt footſtep in all the Authors of this ſecond Age. We do not doubt at all, but that they did ſerve themſelves of that Unction of which the Evangeliſt and Apoſtle ſpeak, an Unction wherewith they ſerved themſelves for the miraculous Cure of Diſeaſes. As in the ſecond and third Ages there continued in the Church ſome Remainders of the Gift of Healing, they might alſo ſerve themſelves with the Ceremony of Unction. But boldly defie your Converters to ſhew you, any Example of a Man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that was anointed with Oil in the ſecond Age, with this intent to make the paſſage of death more eaſie to him.</p>
               <p>

Preſs them with the ſame confidence about their other falſe Sacraments, Orders, Penance, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and oblige them to ſhew you by antiquity in the ſecond Age, that the Doctors of the Church did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, as Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Purgatory in Popery is a Foundation upon which they build an infinite number of idolatrous and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Worſhips; for which reaſon 'tis of importance to ſee what Men believed of it in the ſecond Age of the Church. The State of Souls after death hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been an Abyſs, in which Men have ſeen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Revelation. And for that reaſon the Pagans fell in this regard into prodigious Errors; and the Jews, before our Saviour, floated about in great Uncertainties. The Primitive Chriſtians fell cloſe to that which our Lord ſaid to the good Thief: <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</hi> To that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had taught, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>That if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>when we depart from hence we ſhall be with Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> To that which the Holy Spirit hath ſaid in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that <hi>thoſe which die in the Lord are happy, and their works follow them.</hi> About the middle of the ſecond Age, a Chriſtian apparently come over from Judaiſm, but bred up in the Schools of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> having ſuck'd the Spirit of Fables and Lies (wherewith thoſe two Nations are juſtly reproached) forged the Oracles, which he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the <hi>Sybils,</hi> he cauſed to enter there as Oracles of thoſe ancient Propheteſſes, all that which he believed proper to ſupport the Chriſtian Religion, and render it plauſible to the Pagans. The better to perſuade the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he there mingled their Fables; and to pleaſe the Philoſophers, he entered their Dreams there, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf all things to all Men, that he might gain ſome. Among other Philoſophick Dreams he inſerts two in his Work: The firſt was drawn from the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Philoſophy: 'Twas that there was a certain ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49990:76"/>place, into which he pretended the Souls of the Faithful were carried after death, and where they were lodged till the Day of Judgment, without enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the happy viſion of God. The other was this, that at the end of the World, there would be a great Fire, through which all Men muſt paſs that ſhould be ſaved. An imagination which ſeems to have ſome likeneſs to the <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſophy, which teaches, that the World would be burnt, after which it would return into the State wherein it was at the beginning, and in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual viciſſitude paſs through the ſame Revolutions and Changes. Or rather, 'tis taken from what the Holy Scripture ſays, that the World at laſt muſt be burnt by Fire.</p>
               <p>We are not able to ſay how theſe two Opinions, the one concer<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ng the ſeparate ſtate of Souls, and the other concerning the Torrent of Fire, through which they ought to paſs, did readily diffuſe themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe which had any Learning, and read any thing beſides the Sacred Volumes. The Ancients, good Men, and credulous, being raviſhed to find Books, under the name of Pagan Propheſies, which foretold the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, his Names, his Paſſion, the Circumſtances of his Birth, of his Life, Death and Reſurrection, much more clearly than the true Prophets, embraced with greedineſs what they found in theſe falſe Propheſies. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> who wrote well nigh in the ſame time that theſe falſe Oracles were forged, falls into the perſuaſion, that Souls after death are in a ſeparate place, where even in ſome ſort they are ſubject to the Power and Perſecution of the Devil. From thence it comes to paſs, that he ſaid it was the Devil that cauſed the true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> to aſcend, by the Charms of the Witch of <hi>Endor:</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Dial. cum Tryph.</note> 
                  <hi>For which reaſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>when a perſon is near death, you ought to pray, that his Soul don't fall under ſuch a power.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49990:77"/>S. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> the moſt conſiderable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this ſecond Age, was of the ſame opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this ſeparate place, where all Souls muſt be incloſed until the Day of Judgment, without ſeeing the Face of God.<note n="*" place="margin">Adverſ. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. lib. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> He calls this place Paradiſe, whither <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were tranſported, but he alſo calls it <hi>Hades,</hi> Hell, and a place inviſible. Note, that this Opinion is univerſally at this day rejected by the Papiſts, and paſſes among them for an Error. Pope <hi>John</hi> XXII. having been accuſed to be of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, there was a terrible noiſe about it, and he was forced to retract it. Now this Opinion is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Purgatory. For as we ſhall ſee afterward, this place changes, by little and little, its-nature, until at length they made of it a place of Torments and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for the purging of Souls.</p>
               <p>This ſeparate ſtate produced, a little while after, Prayer for the Dead, which we ſhall ſee had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal about the beginning of the third Age. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nevertheleſs we ſee nothing in the ſecond, unleſs it be towards its end. On the contrary, <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us, that we muſt pray for dying Souls, to the end, that (in the place of their Separation) they fall not under the Power of Devils. He would not have failed to have added, that we muſt pray for Souls after death, to the end, that we might draw them from under the power of Devils, if Prayers for the dead had then been in uſe.</p>
               <p>On the Subject of this praying for the Dead, whereof they make ſuch great boaſts in Antiquity, tell them theſe three things,
<list>
                     <item>1. That it was not in uſe in the firſt and ſecond Age.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Reaſon why they began to pray for the Dead, is very different from that which cauſes Prayers for them at this day. At this day 'tis to draw them from Purgatory; then it was, to the end, that in the terreſtrial Paradiſe, or other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49990:77"/>place of Separation where they were, God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their reſt and joy; for it was believed, that they were there in the beginning of Happineſs.</item>
                     <item>3. To conclude, tell them, that theſe Prayers for the Dead are no important buſineſs in Religion, and that they are not the Reaſon of our Separation.</item>
                  </list> After that preſs them to ſhew you in the ſecond Age the leaſt footſteps of this place of Torments, whither penitent Souls muſt go after Death, to pay the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of thoſe puniſhments which they could not ſatisfie during their life. Demand proofs from them, that in this Age the Church prayed for Souls, that they might quickly get out of torment, and you will ſee them forced to confeſs, that there are none.</p>
               <p>I come to the Worſhip and Adoration of Creatures, ſuch as are Relicks, Images, the Bleſſed Virgin, Saints and Angels. They treat this as a ſmall buſineſs: we ſhall have occaſion to prove to you one day, that without running into any extravagance, 'tis a Pagan Idolatry. But for the preſent we will content our ſelves to ſhew you, that we do not find the leaſt footſteps of theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips in the ſecond Age, wherein we now are. If they did invoke Saints, the Bleſſed Virgin, and Angels, if they had Images, if they did kiſs, and adore Relicks, let them ſhew it you, let them cauſe you to read one Author that ſpeaks of it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to produce the words of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> to prove the Worſhip of Angels, <hi>We adore and venerate the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, which is come to us from him, who hath taught us, both us and others, which follow him, and the Army of good Angels, by the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Apol.</hi> 2. He refers the word <hi>we adored,</hi> to that <hi>of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> as if the deſign of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> had been to ſay, that they adored Angels. Whereas he ought to refer <hi>Angels</hi> to the word <hi>teach,</hi> his Senſe being that Jeſus Chriſt hath taught the <hi>Angels</hi> as well as us, the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Goſpel, according to what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays: <hi>To
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49990:78"/>the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God,</hi> Eph. 3.10. It is ſo clear, that this is the Senſe of S. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> that at this day none of your new Doctors dare quote theſe words to prove, that they worſhiped Angels in the ſecond Age. This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage being ſet aſide, let them produce you another. Was there therefore no Saints in theſe Ages? Had they no Martyrs? Why did they not invoke the Apoſtles, that had newly received their Crowns? Why did they then neglect the Interceſſion of the Virgin? Was it that her Credit was not well eſtabliſhed in Heaven at that time, and that ſhe wanted time to obtain the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which at this day ſhe poſſeſſes?</p>
               <p>But why have the Authors of this Age been ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent to ſay, that they adore God alone, and that they adore none but He? <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He hath taught us, that we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore but one only God, when he ſaid, This the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, thou ſhalt worſhip God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Apol. 2. And a little after having quoted thoſe other words of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Render unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are Gods:</hi> He adds 'tis for this reaſon that we adore but one only God. And as to what concerns you, we give you our Services with gladneſs in all other things. Let not your Eyes be dazled by crafty Tricks upon the word <hi>Adore,</hi> as if <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpake of Soveraign Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they give to none but God, according to your Converters; for you ought to be advertiſed, that he ſerves himſelf of the word <hi>Proskunoumen,</hi> which ſignifies all ſorts of Worſhip and Religious Service. A word which ſignifies properly to proſtrate our ſelves, and wherewith the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice</hi> ſerves it ſelf, when it appoints the Worſhip of Images. So the ſenſe is, <hi>We do not proſtrate our ſelves, we do not give any Religious Worſhip but to God.</hi> See if they

Some therefore ſuggeſted to</hi> Nicetas, <hi>Father of</hi> Herod, <hi>and Brother of</hi> Dalces, <hi>to go find out the Proconſul, to adviſe him not to give us the body, for fear,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that having abandoned Chriſt, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may come to Worſhip him; it was at the ſuggeſtion of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and at their preſſing ſollicitation, that theſe Men thus repreſented the matter. For they were the</hi> Jews <hi>that obſerved our Brethren, when they endeavoured to take the body from the Pile of Wood. Fools which know not that we can never forſake Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death, for all thoſe that muſt be ſaved, nor ſerve any other. For we Adore him as the Son of God, and as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49990:79"/>for the Martyrs, we love them, and are kind to them as Diſciples, and imitators of the Lord, becauſe of the great love which they have ſhewn to their King, and Maſter, and we wiſh to be their Aſſociates, and fellow Diſciples. The Centurion therefore ſeeing the obſtinacy of the</hi> Jews, <hi>cauſed the body to be burnt upon the place, according to the cuſtom. After which we gathered together his Bones, more precious than the moſt precious Stones, and more pure than Gold, and laid them up in a convenient place. In which place if it be poſſible for us, and God permit it, we will hold our Aſſemblies to Celebrate with joy, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Birth day of his Martyrdom, in memory of thoſe who have undergone this glorious Combat, and to inſtruct, and confirm our deſcendents by ſuch an example.</hi> The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is altogether ſuch as we would wiſh, for we there ſee all which we ſearch after, and what was the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ancient Chriſtians with reſpect to Relicks, and Saints, and from whence began the Superſtition, and Idolatry which after appeared in the World. Firſt of all you ſee that in the ſecond Age they ſerved no other but God, <hi>we ſerve no other but God.</hi> Secondly, That the Worſhip given to the Martyrs was a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of love, and ſimple imitation, <hi>we love them and have a kindneſs for them.</hi> Theſe people had loſt all ſenſe not to have added, and <hi>we pray to them,</hi> if ſo be they had them prayed to the Martyrs. Thirdly, That they had no regard to the merits of Saints, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, nor did they pray to God to make us partakers of them, <hi>we wiſh to be their Companions, and fellow Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> They might as eaſily have ſaid, as they ſay now adays, <hi>we deſire to be made partakers of their merits.</hi> Fourthly, That they did not aſſemble at the Tombs of the Martyrs, that they might invocate and ſerve them, but only with deſign to <hi>celebrate the Birth-day of their Martyrdom, and the memory of their Sufferings.</hi> It is an amazing ſtupidity not to have added, and <hi>to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our ſelves to their prayers, and interceſſion,</hi> if any
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49990:79"/>ſuch thing had been in uſe. Fifthly, That they did not rend the Bodies of Martyrs in pieces, nor diſtribute their Bones to fill Reliquaire's. For they <hi>took the bones of</hi> Polycarpus, <hi>and laid them in a convenient place:</hi> that is to ſay, they laid them honorably in a Tomb. In all this we ſee the innocence of the worſhip of the ancient Chriſtians. But in that which follows we ſee the firſt bloomings from whence afterward proceeded Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſee here an exceſſive love, which Chriſtians did ſhew towards the bodies of Martyrs, they ſay that <hi>they are more precious than the moſt precious Stones, and more pure than the pureſt Gold.</hi> 2. They aſſembled upon their Tombs, and their burying places ſerved them as Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not ſimply through neceſſity, for they might have aſſembled more conveniently in Houſes, but becauſe they believed thoſe places more Holy, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to excite Devotion, becauſe of the memory of the Martyrs. 3. They Conſecrated certain days to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Paſſion day of the Martyrs. Indeed they did not Invoke, or Pray to them, but nevertheleſs this was done in their honor, as we Celebrate the Birth-day of a Prince, to whom we give no kind of Religious Worſhip, and this is that which the Ancient Chriſtians call here, <hi>to communicate with the body of the Martyr:</hi> that is to ſay, aſſemble where he was buryed, Pray to God, and Celebrate the Myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion in the ſame place, and even over the Tomb of the Martyr.</p>
               <p>In this there is nothing Criminal, all is done with a good meaning. Nevertheleſs we ſhall ſee how inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly all did degenerate into Superſtition. It does not appear that either they Prayed to <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> or that they Prayed for him, on the day Conſecrated to his memory: but we ſhall ſee in the third Age they Prayed for the Martyrs, and in the fourth Age they Prayed to them. Give attention to this paſſage I earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49990:80"/>
As to what appertains to Images, I think, I ſhall do a thing of great advantage, if I prove, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church had none in their Temples in the ſecond Age, for it will appear by the Ages following, that they had all ſorts of Images, even out of Temples, in the greateſt abhorrence.</p>
               <p>Faſts, Lent, Abſtinence from certain Meats, and other Mortifications of like kind, which makes ſo great a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, which dazle the Eyes of ſome of our New Converts, were intirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the ſecond Age. We there ſee, and obſerve Prayers, and Faſts very often, but there is nothing Read which may make us ſuſpect, that they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to certain days of the week, or certain months of the year: all the days of Prayer, except the Lords day, were almoſt always days of Faſting. But it was by accident, becauſe the Faſting of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was often joyned with Prayer, that the Ancient Chriſtians made it a duty to Faſt on days of Prayer. But it was a thing unheard of, preciſely to make Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to conſiſt of Faſting, without any reſpect to Prayer, and thoſe that do affirm it was the uſe of the Primitive Church muſt prove it. Now we are certain, that they cannot find any proof thereof in the Writings of the ſecond Age. And as to what remains, as we ſhall make it appear by the cleareſt evidence, that the Popiſh Faſts were unknown in the third Age, it will appear by conſequence, that they were of no uſe in the ſecond, only it appears that they prepared for the Communion of <hi>Eaſter</hi> by a Faſt of two days. St. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> writ to Victor Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> on occaſion of the Controverſie touching the day on which they ought to Celebrate <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Euſeb. Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 5. cap. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>is not only diſputed concerning</hi> Eaſter-day, <hi>but alſo concerning the form of the Faſts antecedent thereto, for ſome think they ought not to Faſt but one day, others two, others more, and others meaſure
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49990:80"/>their Faſt-day by the ſpace of twenty four hours, night and day, and this diverſity in the obſervation of the Faſt, had not its being in our Age, but hath begun from the time of our Fathers, who by negligence, ſimplicity, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, have ſuffered this cuſtom to ſlip in. Nevertheleſs they lived in peace with each other, and we retain it to this day.</hi> Obſerve well, it is not Lent, but the beginning, and original thereof. Theſe forty hours of Faſt are greatned, and grown up to forty days. So it is, that the moſt innocent practices have been the original of Superſtition, ſo dangerous is it, to make Innovations, although they ſeem without hazardous conſequence, let them ſhew you other ſolemn Faſts beſides this in the ſecond Age.</p>
               <p>It remains, that we ſpeak a word concerning the Pope, and the prodigious Authority he arrogates to himſelf. It is a Capital affair in Popery, he is the Principle of Unity, he is the Centre unto which your Converters tell you, you ought to be united, if you will be ſaved. God knows what they think of it, but we defie them to ſhew you, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had then any Superiority over other Churches. We may aſſure you without raſhneſs, that the moſt part of the Churches, which were in the extreme Parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſcarce knew whether there were any ſuch thing as a Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they neither knew the name of its Biſhop, nor the form of its Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Cuſtoms, and therefore were far enough from being ſubject to its Orders, and Decrees. We may alſo aſſure you, there were alſo Chriſtians in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and in the fartheſt parts of the Eaſt, which knew not whether there were a <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the World. Send your Converters to the famous <hi>de Launy,</hi> Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who makes appear with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient clearneſs, and evidence, the independence of other Churches, and the few bonds and ties that they had with <hi>Rome,</hi> by proving, that the adherence they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49990:81"/>had to the <hi>Roman</hi> Seat, was not accounted neceſſary in any Age of the ancient Church. They produce to you in the ſecond Age <hi>Victor,</hi> who cut off from his Communion the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> on occaſion of the Controverſie about Eaſter-Day. But you ought to underſtand, that this was an attempt without example, and which had no effect, but was deſpiſed of all the World. And beſides this was no right, that was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> for other Churches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have that right of cutting off other Churches from their Communion, as well as that of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the nearer the Churches of the World were to <hi>Rome,</hi> the more reſpect and conſideration they had for the Church which was there. The Churches which were without the Bounds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ſcarce knew that there was a Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Provinces at a diſtance from <hi>Italy,</hi> ſuch were <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> beheld her ſo far off, that they ſcarce knew ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Cuſtoms, or her Doctrine, nor did they think themſelves under any obligation to be inſtructed in them, or to follow them. And therefore they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time to celebrate Eaſter with the Jews, and to rebaptize Hereticks, without any regard to the Deciſions of <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Churches of <hi>France,</hi> which beheld her near at hand, had her in greater value and eſtimation, becauſe they were ſmitten and amazed, not at the Majeſty of the Church, but at the Majeſty of the Empire, which had its Seat at <hi>Rome.</hi> This is it which made <hi>Ireneus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That it was neceſſary, that the whole Church ſhould travel to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its more powerful principality.</hi> That is to ſay, becauſe it was the Seat of the Empire, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come thither, and that Chriſtians were found there of all the Provinces of the Empire, from whoſe Mouths might be learn'd what was that Faith which was ſcattered all over the Earth. Behold what was
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49990:81"/>the Chriſtianity of the ſecond Age. And behold the Additions that we find there, which afterward was the Seed of Superſtition and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all they mingled Water with the Wine in the Euchariſt, which was not uſed in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. 2. They carried the Sacrament to the abſent, which was not uſual neither in the Apoſtolick Church. 3. They undertook a cuſtom of bringing Offerings, and Alms, not in Silver, but in Merchandize, Bread, Wine, Corn, Raiſins, Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of that they offered on the Holy Table thoſe things, which might be of uſe in the publick Service, whereas in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Church we ſee no other Alms, but ſuch as were gathered by the Hands of the Deacons, either at the end, or beginning of their Aſſemblies. 4. Of theſe Alms of the Believers, they made Oblations to God, conſecrating them by Prayer. 5. At the end of their Prayers before the Communion they added the mutual kiſs, which was not of Apoſtolick Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and was afterwards aboliſhed. 6. Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons entertained an opinion of the ſeparate ſtate for Souls after death, a third place which was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Apoſtles. 7. They conceive an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Love for the Bones of the Martyrs, nevertheleſs without giving them any kind of Worſhip, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Homage. This exceſſive love for Bones was not reaſonable, nor was it of the Apoſtolick Age. 8. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the ſecond Age they appointed Feaſts, to celebrate the memories of the Martyrs; which was not neither of Apoſtolick Inſtitution. 9. They appointed a day or two for Faſting before Eaſter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the principal Innovations in the ſecond Age, in which there is nothing almoſt that can be blamed, conſidered in it ſelf, and ſeparated from the Fruits and Conſequences thereof.</p>
               <p>To conclude, to the end, that you be not abuſed by falſe Authors, you ought to know that we entertain
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49990:82"/>none for the Writers of the ſecond Age, but theſe: S. <hi>Clement,</hi> the Diſciple of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who writ an Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> of whom we have many Epiſtles, concerning which the Learned doubt with reaſon, but we will nevertheleſs receive them in the preſent Affair: S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who wrote an Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> the Epiſtle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Martyrdom of S. <hi>Polycarp: Juſtin Martyr,</hi> whoſe Works ought to be diſtinguiſhed, for there are many among them which are falſly attributed unto him: <hi>Athanagoras</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> of whom we have an Apology for the Chriſtians, and a Diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection: <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of whom we have three Books written to <hi>Autolycus: Tatian,</hi> of whom we have a Diſcourſe in Defence of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and againſt that of the Pagans. And in fine, S. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of whom we have a conſiderable Work againſt the Hereſies of his Times. If they quote unto you the Liturgies of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> of S. <hi>James,</hi> of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Works of <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> the Canons of the Apoſtles, and other like Diſcourſes, you ought to reject them, as being falſe and forged, in the opinion of all the Learned, who have any thing of ſincerity.</p>

            <head>THE SEVENTH PASTORAL LETTER. CONCERNING Songs, and Voices, which were heard in ſeveral places in the Air.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN the laſt of our Letters we engaged our ſelves to communicate unto you certain notable matters of Fact, which ſome of our Brethren have thought adviſeable to impart unto us. Amongſt theſe matters of Fact, I do not think there's any one that better deſerves to be examined, than that which hath been reported to us, That in many places where there have been formerly Churches, Voices have been heard in the Air, ſo perfectly like to our ſinging of Pſalms, that they could not be taken for any thing elſe. If this be true, 'tis a wonder which very well deſerves the labor of our attention. We ſhall think our ſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ungrateful to the Divine Goodneſs, if we ſhould ſuppreſs ſo illuſtrious a Teſtimony of his Approbation. He muſt be bold, in this Age, that dares ſpeak of Prodigies, Marvels, Preſages and other ſuch like things. There are times in which Men believe every
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49990:83"/>thing; in this wherein we now are, they believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I think there is a mean to be choſen, we may not believe every thing, but ſurely ſomething ought to be believed. For this Spirit of Incredulity, and this Character of a brave Spirit, is good for nothing, and I have not as yet diſcovered the uſe thereof. 'Tis true, Credulity hath deſtroyed Religion, and introduced a thouſand Superſtitions; for theſe unhappy Tales of Miracles done at the Tombs of Saints, theſe Apparitions of Souls, theſe pretended Viſions of Spirits, that come from the other World, theſe, ſay I, have produced the Invocation of Saints, the Adoration of Images, Purgatory, Maſſes, the Prayers of the living for the dead. For which reaſon I am content, that Men ſtand upon their Guard, when any thing is debated, and reported concerning wonderful, and pious Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories. The generality of thoſe which are called honeſt Men are come ſo far from thence, that they have caſt themſelves on the other extreme, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing. 'Tis to expoſe a Man's ſelf, and to be turned into Ridicule, to maintain that there have been Miracles, and that there may yet be, they mock at Preſages, and have no Faith for that which they call Prodigies. Nevertheleſs whither goes this, and what will be the Iſſue of it? 'Tis to deny Providence, 'tis to make our ſelves believe, God does not intermeddle in the Affairs here below, and to ruine all the Principles of human Faith, and by conſequence to caſt our ſelves on a perfect Scepticiſm, which is peradventure a diſpoſition of mind the moſt dangerous to Religion of any in the World. By doubting all matters of Fact which have any appearance of extraordinary, they tell us they have no intention to extend it any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Hiſtory of the World. But we don't perceive, that we inſenſibly entertain a habit of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which extends it ſelf to every thing. There is a God, we all conſent thereto. There is a Providence,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49990:83"/>we all profeſs, and avow it. Nothing comes to paſs without him. Is it poſſible, that God ſhould ſo hide himſelf behind his Creatures, and under the veil of ſecond Cauſes, that he ſhould never at any time, tho never ſo little, draw aſide the Curtain? If we have taken a reſolution to deny the truth of all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary matters of Fact, what ſhall we do with Hiſtory, both ſacred and profane? Can we perſuade our ſelves, that the Hiſtorians of all Ages intended to deceive us, by making us believe, that the great Revolutions which have happened in the Societies of Men, and the Church, have been preceded by extraordinary Events, ſuch as Earthquakes, Signs in Heaven, and Prodigies on Earth? They will ſay the moſt part of theſe Hiſtories are Fables, it may be ſo: but if the moſt part be Fables, there have been ſome which have been true. If there had never been any true Prodigies, they would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported thoſe that were falſe; for falſhood is an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Truth. He muſt have a hardneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence that I underſtand not, that can put all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians in one rank, and range them all together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Forgers of Lies. I admire the agreement of thoſe Writers, which lived two or three thouſand years from one another, who nevertheleſs have all conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to deceive us, according to our Moderns, and there is neither Sorcerers, nor Magicians, nor Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, nor Apparitions of Demons, nor any thing like it. 'Tis much, that theſe Gentlemen have not puſhed on their confidence, even to deny the truth of matters of Fact contained in the Scriptures, which would be very convenient for them. In the times that the Sacred Writers writ their Books, there were all theſe things; and where do we find, that they ought to ceaſe, and that a time was to come, in which Devils ſhould no more deceive Men, and in which he Heaven ſhould ſpeak no more Prodigies? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Hiſtorians have not been infallible, muſt we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49990:84"/>believe they have been all Liars, and in all things? Can a Man, for example, honeſtly call in doubt the prodigies which <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports to us, as coming to paſs a little before the final ruin of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> A Man walked round the City, and its Walls perpetually, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Wo, wo to the Temple, City,</hi> &amp;c. and in fine, during the Siege, as he was upon the Wall, he added, <hi>Wo to me aſo:</hi> that which he never did before, and in the very moment, a great ſtone coming from the Engines of the Beſiegers, knock'd him on the Breſt, and brake him in pieces. A Sword of Fire paſſed over the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for a whole year together, from Eaſt to Weſt. A Voice was heard in the Temple which ſaid, <hi>Let us go hence.</hi> A brazen Gate in the Temple, which eighteen or twenty Men could ſcarce open, opened of it ſelf. It muſt be, that <hi>Joſephus</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to proſtitute his Reputation, reporting ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, the falſeneſs whereof he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of by a thouſand Witneſſes yet living, if they were not true. The Saviour of the World was willing to honor ſome mute preſages, altho he might well have paſſed them by, ſince he had ſo many living Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on his behalf, 'twas his pleaſure that the Heavens ſhould produce a new Star at his Birth, or at leaſt, that the Air ſhould produce a new Meteor, that deſerved that name. And what ſhall we ſay of that great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, which was at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> where an Angel deſcended, troubled the Waters, and the firſt ſick perſon that went into them after the action of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, was healed? This marvel was not ancient, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it had not continued long. 'Tis clear, that this was done about the time that our Lord arrived at the age of thirty years, and entered upon the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; and 'twas an admirable preſage of the coming of him, who is called, <hi>A fountain opened to the houſe of Jacob for ſin, and for uncleanneſs:</hi> whoſe Water, that is to ſay, whoſe Grace, was to heal and cure all our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49990:84"/>Maladies. I could bring you an infinite number of matters of Fact very well atteſted, that is to ſay, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Prophetick Dreams, Signs ſeen in the Air, and in the Heavens, which have been Preſages of Events little leſs conſiderable than thoſe we ſee at preſent. 'Tis true, that under color of Signs and Marvels, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and an hundred Fables have paſſed current in the World; but all that we ought to conclude thence is, that every wiſe Man will have great Securities before he will believe. As ſoon as any event may have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes, it ſignifies nothing according to theſe Gentlemen, as if God was not at all the Maſter of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes, and could not diſpoſe them for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of certain Effects, when he would preſage great Revolutions in the World. It ſeems to me, that Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes have their natural Cauſes, and ſo have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, Peſtilences and Wars: nevertheleſs Jeſus Chriſt puts theſe things among thoſe things which are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage his coming. <hi>Nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom, there ſhall be famines, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes and peſtilences in divers countries.</hi> And why may we not interpret that which he adds of Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and of Signs which are ſeen in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, the Stars ſhall fall from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken.</hi> 'Tis believed, that this is a Deſcription of what ſhall be at the laſt Day of Judgment; but if this were a place for it, I could prove, that it is no ſuch thing. Not that I am perſuaded all Eclipſes, and all Earthquakes are Preſages; but there are ſuch Circumſtances of time and place, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Signs, that a Man cannot (as I think) without raſhneſs deny, that the Providence of God doth diſpenſe them to ſtrike the minds of Men with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and make them attentive to his Judgments. What ſhall we ſay concerning the Bow in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? It is made without doubt by natural Cauſes.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49990:85"/>Nevertheleſs it has been the pleaſure of God in all Ages of the World, that it ſhould be a Sign by Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to aſſure Mankind, that there ſhould never be an univerſal Deluge upon the earth. God granted to <hi>Gideon</hi> a Sign in Nature to aſſure him of the truth of his Miſſion. <hi>Ezekias</hi> received one in the Sun, at leaſt, in the ſhadow of the Sun on the Dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> as a Sign of his reſtauration to life, we may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imagine, that 'tis contrary to the order of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to do extraordinary things in nature for the marking and noting extraordinary events in the World. Let us conclude therefore, that the Credulity of our Anceſtors hath cauſed many miſchievous Tales to be received as faithful Hiſtories; but alſo, that it hath been the cauſe, that very faithful Hiſtories do at this day paſs for falſe Tales. I could not refuſe this little Prologue to the Year wherein we are preſently to engage, as abundant in Prodigies as any has been for a long time: for on all ſides, we have heard ſpeak of nothing but extraordinary Storms, Fires falling from Heaven, others coming out of the Earth, of Signs ſpeaking loud, which have appeared in the Air, of Inſects of an unknown ſhape, which have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have fallen from Heaven. The Writers of publick News have not been able to forbear remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and making their Reflections thereon. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 'tis the intereſt of the publick to make evident all theſe Events; and there lies an Obligation on thoſe that deſire to fear God, to give a very exact Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation concerning all theſe Prodigies; if they intend to learn us any thing concerning them, we intreat them, that it be not on Reports and Hear-ſays, yea, that it be not on the report of perſons whoſe fidelity is not very well known; for we have no deſign to deceive either our ſelves or others: this will be known by the manner wherein we ſhall report a matter of Fact, that is to ſay, the ſinging of Pſalms in the Air, which has been heard in divers places.</p>

It is near a year ſince, that we firſt heard any ſpeech concerning it, and they told us, that theſe Singings had been heard in <hi>Bearne,</hi> the firſt Province whither the Dragoons were ſent. Behold our Witneſſes, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one will judge of what worth they are. Monſieur <hi>Magendie,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Orthez,</hi> having been queſtioned concerning this Affair, hath interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated divers perſons, according as it appears by his Certificate.</p>

                           <hi>I do declare, that Monſieur</hi> de Bazin, <hi>a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and an Inhabitant of</hi> Orthez <hi>in</hi> Bearne, <hi>hath told me, that walking with ſome of his Friends, after mid-day, near the City of</hi> Orthez, <hi>he heard Voices which ſung Pſalms, and as he imagined, that it might be ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that waſhed Linnen in a certain River which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through</hi> Orthez, <hi>he ran to them to demand of them, whether it were they that ſung; they told him, that it was not they, and that they themſelves for a long time had heard the ſame ſinging of Pſalms. This happened ſome months before the Interdiction of our Church. The ſaid Monſieur</hi> Bazin <hi>is a very honeſt Man, very judicious, and of great integrity.</hi>
2. <hi>I add, that Mademoiſelle</hi> de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenaue of <hi>Orthez, ſaid to perſons worthy of credit, that being not able to believe that which was ſaid concerning this ſinging of Pſalms, a Woman ſaid to her, that if ſhe had the curioſity to hear them ſing, ſhe would come and take her at her own Houſe, at a time convenient, which ſhe did; for this Woman being at eleven of the clock at night in the uttermoſt part of the City, with multitudes of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to hear theſe Voices which ſung in the Air the Praiſes of God, having heard this ſinging of Pſalms, ſhe ran to Mademoiſelle</hi> de Caſenaue, <hi>who immediately gets out of her Bed, cauſes one of her Neigbours to riſe, and they ran to that quarter of the City which was far removed from her Houſe, where they found multitudes of perſons, who were raviſhed with that pleaſant Melody which they heard in the Air; they themſelves returned to their Houſes, with this great
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49990:86"/>conſolation to have heard thoſe Pſalms ſung in the Air, which they could no more ſing in their Church, which had been interdicted for ſome months paſt; and they added, that it ſeemed to them, that they heard them ſing after the ſame manner which they uſed to ſing in their Church, and that after the ſinging had ceaſed, there was a Voice which ſpake, but after a manner inarticulate and confuſed, ſo that they could not diſtinguiſh what was ſaid. This Gentlewoman is very well worthy of Credit.</hi> 3. <hi>I ſay moreover that an infinite number of the perſons of</hi> Orthez <hi>do ſay, that they have heard the ſinging of Pſalms, which they call the ſinging of Angels, and that they exhorted each other on the day to be preſent in the night, in certain places of the City, to ſatisfie this holy Curioſity, which was the reaſon, that the Magiſtrates of</hi> Orthez publiſhed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, whereby they forbad all perſons from going out of their Houſes, or aſſembling themſelves by night for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Voices, which filled this poor afflicted people with joy, and extraordinary conſolation.<hi>This is it which has been told me concerning this ſinging of Pſalms, to which In find no difficulty to give a full conſent, becauſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have reported it, are of great ſincerity.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49990:86"/>ſo much diſcourſed of all the World over. Moreover he thought, that ſometimes during the whole night, when his Gout hindered him from ſleeping, that he heard the ſame ſinging after a manner leſs diſtinct and intelligible.

And having demanded of her how ſhe knew it was the ſinging of Pſalms; ſhe told them it was becauſe ſhe had heard the ſame thing, at ſuch time as they ſung in the Church of thoſe of the Reformed Religion. And having further asked her how ſhe had heard the ſinging of Pſalms in the Church, ſhe anſwered them, ſhe had been once there at a Baptiſm; but that going to a certain Fountain, ſhe had often heard this ſinging as ſhe paſſed by the Church, at the hours of Preaching, and Prayer. After this Monſieur</hi> Clavier <hi>told me, that the Curate and others ſtrictly forbad her to ſay any more, that ſhe had heard the ſaid ſinging of Pſalms.</hi>

            <p>I whoſe Name is underwritten, certifie to all whom it may concern, that in the year 1685, about the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or <hi>September,</hi> I heard in the Air the ſinging of Pſalms with different Voices, and very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious, and this at two ſeveral times; the firſt time before the Houſe of <hi>Poey,</hi> where I was lying upon a Bank half aſleep, I was awakened by this ſinging of Pſalms, which continued almoſt half an hour. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I went into the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>du Poey,</hi> a Merchant Draper, with whom I wrought at that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Having told this to <hi>Mademoiſelle du Poey</hi> and her Daughters, they were much offended at me, that I had not given them notice of it at the time I heard
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49990:87"/>the ſaid ſinging. The ſecond time, I and many others about an hour after midnight having gone on purpoſe to a place moſt high, and raiſed, in the City, near to <hi>Moncade,</hi> named the <hi>Poſterle,</hi> I heard many Voices in the Air, ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other; withdrawing my ſelf a little, I found Mademoiſelle <hi>des Pagnou,</hi> Daughter of Monſieur <hi>Dombideau,</hi> Merchant of <hi>Oleron,</hi> Wife to Monſieur <hi>des Pagnou,</hi> Merchant-Tanner, accompanied with many other Women of the Neighborhood, I asked them from whence they came. They told me they came from the Bank of a River called <hi>Le Gaur,</hi> which paſſes by the City, near a Mill which they call the <hi>New Mill.</hi> I asked them if they had heard the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms. They anſwered me, Yea. I asked them from what ſide they had heard the Voices: they told me it ſeemed to them it was from the place called the <hi>Poſterle.</hi> I told them I came from thence, and that I had heard thoſe Voices in the Air, and that it ſeemed to me, that they came from that ſide the New Mill ſtood; and both they and I agreed with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that they were in the Air, and that they never had heard Voices ſo pleaſant and charming. My Father (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Neighbor of the ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>des Pagnou</hi>) and thoſe other Women being at the Gate two hours after midnight, with a Marſhal named <hi>Mareſque,</hi> a Papiſt of the Town of <hi>Lembege,</hi> of the Quarter of <hi>Bilbil,</hi> which belongs to the Partement of <hi>Navarre,</hi> my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſay, who had changed his Religion about two years and half ſince, inquiring of theſe Women if they had heard the ſinging of Pſalms. They anſwered, Yea. And I too, ſaid my Father. And <hi>Mareſque</hi> the Marſhal replyed, he had never heard better ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: let Men ſay what they will, for my part, ſaid he, I am perſuaded, that it is a true ſinging of Pſalms. The ſaid Monſieur <hi>Poey,</hi> my Father, and the ſaid <hi>Mareſque</hi> came from a place called <hi>De Part,</hi> near to <hi>Orthez.</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49990:87"/>And I add, that I have heard a Prohibition publiſhed to all ſorts of perſons, at the ſound of a Trumpet, by the Cryer of the City, called <hi>Monleres,</hi> containing, that none were to go out at night to hear the ſinging of Pſalms, under the penalty of Impriſonment. In witneſs whereof I have ſigned the preſent Certificate, as it was deſired of me. Given <hi>November</hi> 22, 1686. Signed <hi>Peter Mauperg</hi> of <hi>Orthez</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi> aged twenty three years.</p>
            <p>One named Monſieur <hi>Bergerit</hi> hath declared under his Signet, this which follows. About the month of <hi>September</hi> laſt, being in my Mothers Houſe, ſhe told me, that the Evening before they had heard ſinging of Pſalms in the Air. I believ'd nothing thereof, but went away to Bed, becauſe I was weary; this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight at night; about half an hour after ſome of the Neighbors came to the Houſe to inquire whether I were ſo great a fool to ſing Pſalms, conſidering the ſtrict Prohibition had been made thereof; and at the ſame inſtant my Mother entered into the Chamber to awake, and tell me, that Pſalms were ſung in the Air. I awoke, and awaking, heard this ſinging of Pſalms, and thought it had been in the Garden belonging to the Houſe. I aroſe and went forth into the ſtreet <hi>Montcade</hi> at <hi>Orthez,</hi> where all the Neighborhood were gathered together, and they heard the ſinging of Pſalms repeated two or three ſeveral times. Signed <hi>Bergerit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A perſon named <hi>John de la Bordette,</hi> hath declared under his Signet, this which follows. About the month of <hi>September</hi> laſt, being in my Houſe at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thez,</hi> the place of my Habitation, and having heard, that it was ſaid, that Pſalms were ſung, I went out into the ſtreet about eight in the Evening, to ſee and hear what was ſaid, and done, and I heard in the Air Voices which formed a Vocal Muſick perfectly, like to the ſinging of Pſalms. Nevertheleſs, without being able to diſtinguiſh what Pſalm it was. Of the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49990:88"/>of this ſame thing many perſons of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood were witneſſes. Another time as I was at the Wine Preſs, amidſt the Vines, above ten in the evening, I heard the ſame thing with many other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Signed <hi>John De la Bordette.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Damoſel called Mademoiſelle <hi>Deformalagues,</hi> hath declared under her Signet, in theſe words. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwritten, do declare in the preſence of God, that being at <hi>Orthez</hi> in <hi>Biar,</hi> the place of my Habitation, I heard clearly at three ſeveral times, on the month of <hi>October</hi> laſt, this which follows.</p>
            <p>On a <hi>Friday</hi> in the ſaid month of <hi>October,</hi> about 8 or 9 at night, being in my Chamber, ſome Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours called me with earneſtneſs, ſaying, that I muſt haſten to hear the Angels ſinging Pſalms; I haſtily went out of the Houſe, and being arrived at the Street called St. <hi>Gille,</hi> I there found a great number of people, which had ran together from all parts to hear this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Muſick. And at that inſtant my Ears were ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a Melody ſo raviſhing, that I never heard any thing like it. I could very well diſcern the Air and Tune of our Pſalms, which were ſung admirably well. I heard many perſons ſay, they heard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the firſt verſe of the 42. Pſalm. <hi>Like as the hart doth breach and bray.</hi> There were others that confirmed the ſame, and aſſured us moreover that they had heard the whole Pſalm Sung. For my part I do acknowledg that I could not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the words. I only heard a charming Muſick, which repreſented to me a great number of Voices that agreed exceeding well. There was one that raiſed his Voice above the reſt, and made himſelf obſerved when the reſt had done. After I had heard a long while this Melody with raviſhment; I perceived that theſe Voices drew off, and abated by little and little, until they were inſenſibly loſt in the Air.</p>
            <p>The ſame evening being on my return, and near
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49990:88"/>the Gate of my Houſe, with many of my Neighbours, as we diſcourſed together of the marvellous things that we had heard, behold all of a ſudden the ſame Voices which we had heard ſome hours before, ſtriking again our Ears with great pleaſure, they filled us anew with raviſhment, for the ſpace of one quarter of an hour, after which this Melody withdrew, as it had done at the firſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, being at the door of my Houſe, with one of my Relations at Evening, we both heard a great number of Voices in the Air, which reſounded with ſtrength, and made themſelves heard with the greateſt clearneſs: hearing this melodious ſinging, I ran haſtily to the Lodgings of a Popiſh Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who dwelt in my Houſe, and was that year one of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Orthez,</hi> to the end that he himſelf might hear this wonderful Melody. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me to hear what it was. The ſinging founded clearly, the night being calm and ſerene, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hear nothing. A while after the Voices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced themſelves, and then having preſſed this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to tell me if he heard the ſinging, he could no longer diſſemble the truth. It is true ſaid he (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the world) I hear very lovely ſinging. I think I hear the Voice of ſuch an one, and ſuch an one, naming ſeveral perſons in <hi>Orthez,</hi> which ſung exceeding well; to this I replyed, Monſieur, if Men hold their peace, the very ſtones will ſpeak: but he, as if he had been troubled at the confeſſion he had made, complains that, alas, I obſerve here a crafty wile of the Devil, he cauſes theſe Voices to be heard in the Air, to keep the World in error, and hinder this poor people from Converting, and embracing the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith. Whereupon I inquired if he had ever heard that the Devil ſung the praiſes of God; he ſmiled, and retired haſtily to his Lodgings: nevertheleſs we bleſs God for the favor that he hath done us, in admoniſhing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49990:89"/>us of our duty by theſe heavenly Voices, who melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſung thoſe holy Hymns, which we were wont to ſound forth in our Church, which was then laid waſt and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>I proteſt before God that theſe things are ſo as I have reported them, and I am very glad to make known theſe truths, for the Edification of all thoſe that fear the Lord. In Teſtimony whereof I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my ſelf at <hi>Amſterdam, September</hi> 4. 1686. <hi>V. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formalagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do maintain that a Teſtimony, ſuch as this, though it were alone, is capable of putting the ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity to diſtreſs: for what that is reaſonable can be ſaid againſt it? It will be ſaid this is the Teſtimony of a Woman, but by being a Woman hath ſhe renounced all Honor, Shame, and Conſcience, in the matter of Teſtimony? She muſt have renounced all thoſe things, to atteſt with an Oath a matter of Fact, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumſtances. She is but a Woman, but ſhe is not a Woman that reports ſome Viſions of the night, or particular Revelations, ſhe is a Woman that reports things that happened in publick, and whereof ſhe hath for witneſſes with her ſelf many hundreds of perſons. Though ſhe be a Woman, it does not follow but ſhe may be endued with good underſtanding: now ſhe muſt have loſt all ſenſe to advance ſuch a falſity, and to expoſe her ſelf to be overwhelmed with ſhame, as a maker of Fables: to conclude, ſhe is a Woman, but ſhe ſpeaks of a thing happened not above ſeven days ago, if I may ſo ſay.</p>
            <p>To conclude, behold a Memorial of Monſieur <hi>de Braſſalay,</hi> a Gentleman of Honor, and acknowledged ſuch by all that know him.</p>
            <p>Some days before the Interdiction of the Churches of <hi>Bearn,</hi> there were many perſons, that heard the ſinging of Pſalms in the Air, in the City of <hi>Orthez.</hi> The firſt that heard it was <hi>Lichigaray Brunier,</hi> a Lawyer,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49990:89"/>revolted ſome years ſince, the moſt malignant of the Perſecutors, and who continually ſtirred up troubles to thoſe of the Reformed Religion. He roſe from his Bed to go tell the Curate, that there was an Aſſembly of people that ſung Pſalms without the City, he alſo went to a Serjeant named <hi>Gowlan,</hi> to conduct him to the place where he thought to ſurprize them, but this Popiſh Serjeant having laid his Ear to the Window, anſwered him there was nothing to be done, for he well perceived the ſinging was in the Air. Afterward it was heard from time to time, more than a month, by divers perſons, ſometimes at night, and ſometimes by day: among others <hi>Lichagaray Canneille,</hi> an Elder of the Church of <hi>Orthez,</hi> proteſted and told me, that ſitting upon the bank of the River, a thouſand Paces from the City, reading in a Book, he heard a great ſinging of Pſalms on that ſide the Church ſtands, which is in the midſt of the City, and not doubting at all that is was an ordinary Aſſembly, that were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at Evening Prayers, which was then very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, becauſe of the hazardous conjuncture, and conſiſted at the leaſt of two or three thouſand ſouls, he haſted to go thither, and always heard a great ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms till he was entered into the City, but having found the doors of the Church ſhut, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours told him, that it was not yet the hour of Prayer. It is to no purpoſe to ſay they ſung in ſome Cavern or Cave, for there is nothing but Houſes, and the parts adjacent to <hi>Orthez</hi> are Vineyards, Meadows, and Fields, it has been a long time ſince forbidden to ſing Pſalms in Houſes, and no body has dared to venture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and leaſt of all would they think thereon in a time when they every hour feared the Interdiction of their Church, and when they adviſed by all ſorts of methods to defend themſelves from it. Moreover this Elder hath aſſured me, that he never heard more lofty ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church. This he told me, being in <hi>Bearne,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49990:90"/>about ſixteen months ſince, in the preſence of very many honeſt Men.</p>
            <p>After the Church of <hi>Orthez</hi> was razed to the ground, this ſinging of Pſalms was heard no more for ſome time, but about the months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> laſt, it was heard by moſt part of the people of <hi>Orthez,</hi> and many others of the Country which tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried till night before they went home on Market-days, thoſe of the Suburbs, as well as thoſe of the City, heard it, every one in his Quarter, ordinarily at the ſame hour, <hi>viz.</hi> between eight and nine at night, ſome heard the words, others heard the Tune of the Pſalms, and there is not it may be, a Houſe in <hi>Orthez</hi> of which ſome one of the Family hath not heard it. The ſaid <hi>Lichiguray Bruneir,</hi> went one night, he and two others, to that part where they heard this ſinging without the City, and they all three heard the ſinging for a long time over their Heads, the Tune of the 138. Pſalm, whereof they could not hear diſtinctly but theſe words: <hi>Toward thy holy Temple I will look and worſhip thee, and praiſed in my thankful mouth, thy holy name ſhall be: even for thy loving kindneſs ſake, and for thy truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, for thou thy name, haſt by thy word, advanced over all. Du Faur</hi> a Phyſician, and Magiſtrate of the City, another Papiſt, heard it divers times, but their malice made them ſay they were Sorcerers and Devils. A young Damoſel of the Suburbs of <hi>Moncade,</hi> which is near the Caſtle, the ancient Habitation of the Lords of <hi>Bearn,</hi> heard this ſinging, being in her Bed; ſhe roſe, and cauſed more than fifty perſons to go out, who having heard it fell on their Knees, and wept through the joy they conceived to hear ſo incomparable a Melody in the Air, which continued more than half an hour. And it muſt be known that it was in a place much raiſed above the City, even as a very high Mountain, and the people heard this ſinging over their Heads, as if it had been in the Clouds: I have heard an honeſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49990:90"/>Man, who was one of the Spectators, make this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who poured out Tears then when he ſpake of it: the ſame thing I have heard from other places. To conclude, it is impoſſible to doubt of a truth, which the far greateſt part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Orthez</hi> are able to certifie.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> and the Intendent of <hi>Bearn,</hi> have alſo given their Teſtimony thereto by a Decree, which forbids Men to go hear theſe Pſalms, and to ſay they have heard it on the forfeiture of five hundred Crowns: and by another Ordinance, which forbids the ſame thing, under the forfeiture of two thouſand Crowns. The Conſuls of <hi>Orthez</hi> did publiſh theſe Ordinances in their City.</p>
            <p>I do not as yet very well underſtand, what can be oppoſed to the Teſtimony of Monſieur <hi>Braſſalny.</hi> Thoſe that know him as we do, know that he is not of a temper to impoſe upon any one, nor to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be impoſed upon by any one whoever he be. Thoſe things which he reports are not hear-ſays at a great diſtance, for they are perſons of Credit an Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who put into his Hands thoſe things which they themſelves heard.</p>
            <p>If after all this, the matter of Fact be falſe, I do avow that we muſt no more believe any thing. But there are but few people into whoſe minds it can enter, that two or three thouſand perſons, (for there are not leſs of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Orthez</hi>) ſhould conſpire to lye about an affair, which after all, is not of any great concernment to them. For although the Angels ſhould not have ſung in the Air, their Religion would not be the leſs true. Moreover it is to be obſerved, that our people are not Educated in the Spirit of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Credulity for Miracles. On the contrary, it is known that we have always made it part of our buſineſs to defend them againſt thoſe deluſions. Beſides this he muſt have an impudence which cannot be found but in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49990:91"/>very few Men, to feign events as happening in the view of a whole City, and to introduce on the Stage, Men who can give them the lye, and whoſe intereſt it is ſo to do. To conclude, I do not know how any one can imagine that the Magiſtrates of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thez,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> ſhould publiſh Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to hinder Men from going to hear theſe Voices, if the thing it ſelf were falſe. At leaſt it muſt be granted that the Reformed in <hi>Orthez</hi> did believe they heard it. Incredulity which always finds out ſome intrenchment, and defence for it ſelf, will demand that we produce the Ordinances of the Parliament of <hi>Pau,</hi> and of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Orthez.</hi> It is not at all probable, that Men who would ſtifle both the knowledg, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſo extraordinary an event, and which was ſo diſadvantageous to them, ſhould be willing to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them upon Paper, and yet much leſs Print, and deliver theſe Ordinances, which would have immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized the memory of that Fact, which they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhould be forgotten. But having heard above the Depoſition of a perſon of honor, who ſaid that he heard with his Ears, the publication of theſe Prohibitions, he muſt be very incredulous that will deny the truth of this circumſtance. And he muſt ſuppoſe that two thouſand perſons are furniſhed with a great meaſure of impudence to attribute to a Court of Juſtice, and to the Magiſtrates of a City, a thing that is falſe. If this be not ſufficient to convince thoſe that doubt, they may tarry if they pleaſe, till Men have found the ſecret of collecting the impreſſions that words make upon the Air, and rendring them viſible, and then they will be made to ſee all things in their Original.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing hath happened in <hi>Cevennes:</hi> as this Country is full of Mountains, where there are Eccho's, which multiply and return the Voice, and as night Aſſemblies have continually been made there where they ſing Pſalms with a loud Voice, therefore the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49990:91"/>of ſingings, which have been made in the Air, would be more ſuſpected by me. But the Affair of <hi>Orthez,</hi> which is a Country cloſe and without Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, being well proved, I ſee no reaſon to doubt of that of <hi>Cevennes,</hi> for which reaſon without ſcruple we will produce the Certificates which come from that Country.</p>
            <p>The firſt Certificate. I Certifie that one of my Siſters wrote to me on <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. laſt, from a place called <hi>Collet,</hi> in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> where ſhe then was, in theſe words.</p>

                  <hi>We ſee ſtrange things in all the places in</hi> Cevennes, <hi>we hear ſinging of Pſalms in the Air by night, as if it were in the Church.</hi> Wedneſday <hi>laſt I was lying alone in my Chamber, and about midnight I heard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the roof a Voice very ſhrill, which awoke me, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards five of ſix other Voices that aſſiſted it, and they ſung five or ſix verſes of the fifth Pſalm: all thoſe of the Houſe heard it many times.</hi>
               </q> The ſaid Monſieur of the <hi>Dark Valley,</hi> confirmed me in this belief, by a ſecond Letter, <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. 1686. That this ſinging of Pſalms doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly continue. The ſaid Monſieur adds, now the beating of a Drum is heard, as if Men of War were marching, and this is heard at mid-day in many places. <hi>Barjune,</hi> Miniſter of St. <hi>Marſelle</hi> in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> now fled to <hi>Lauſanna</hi> in <hi>Switzerland.</hi>

                  <hi>How happy are you my dear Couſin, that you can Pray, and ſing the Praiſes of God in publick, when in the mean time ſo many good ſouls have their mouths ſtopped, and dare not diſcover that which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in their minds. But as to the buſineſs of ſinging the Praiſes of God, it is neceſſary that I ſpeak to you of the miracle which makes ſo much noiſe in this Country, which is, that ſince the intire loſs of our Churches, and our Paſtors, there has been heard in the Air Voices, and ſounds of Inſtruments, very melodious, and that which is moſt extraordinary, is that many perſons diſtinguiſh the Tunes of the Pſalms, and I can aſſure you of the truth thereof, ſince I may ſelf have diſtinguiſhed more than thirty. It has been told me that my Brother</hi> (<hi>ſhe means M.</hi> de Mont Vaillant, <hi>elder Brother both of her, and M.</hi> de Vallette) <hi>diſtinguiſhes them all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well. Can you imagine that we hear theſe Voices night and day, and that we can ſo much as doubt that they are Troops of Angels which God ſends to us for Conſolation;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49990:92"/>to aſſure us that he hath not utterly forſaken us, and that our deliverance is at hand, God grant that we may make profit by theſe things. I had forgotten to tell you, that the noiſe of a Drum is alſo heard ſo clearly, that no body can doubt thereof.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been anſwered to this Letter, that this might be natural, conſidering the ſituation of the Country, in which they then made Aſſemblies, together with other circumſtances, to which the following reply was made.</p>
            <p>This <hi>March</hi> 6. 1686. <q>
                  <hi>Be no more incredulous, I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, about the ſinging of Pſalms, for there are ſo many perſons of good underſtandings convinced thereof, that we ought to give up our ſelves to the power of truth. I do avow that the thing paſſes all imagination, but be aſſured that all care imaginable has been taken to prevent deluſion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The two Letters whereof my Brother has made the extracts above, were truly written to me by my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>de Vebron</hi> from <hi>Cevennes,</hi> whoſe Character and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit I ſo well underſtand, that I cannot be deceived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Louiſe Des Vignoles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle <hi>de Vebron,</hi> is a perſon which hath ſo much of Wit, Underſtanding, Honor, and Piety, that I am perſuaded as much as any one can be, that ſhe has no intention to deceive us. I do not at all doubt, but that all thoſe that have known her, will readily give her the ſame teſtimony with my ſelf. She hath always been of the Reformed Religion, and God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her hitherto from the general fall, as it appears by two Letters, the original whereof I preſerve to ſhew them to ſuch as deſire it. <hi>From</hi> Lauſanna, March 30. Styl. Vet. 1686. <hi>Signed</hi> Des Vignoles, <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Lower Languedoc.</p>
            <p>I give the ſame Teſtimony to the Merit and Piety of Mademoiſelle <hi>de Vebron. Baſchi Aubais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may add to theſe Certificates from <hi>Cevennes</hi> and <hi>Bearn,</hi> the Teſtimony of M. <hi>Jacquelot,</hi> Paſtor of the Church of <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> whom we have heard ſay, that he was informed by one of his Pariſhoners (a Man that never did appear to him of a humour inclined to ſell
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49990:93"/>Fables for truth) that two hours after midnight paſſing by the Church of <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> he there heard the ſinging of Pſalms. Teſtimonies of like nature may be reported from many other places, but theſe are enough. As to what remains, I am willing before I conclude here to defend our ſelves againſt an injuſtice, which is very ordinary in this kind of affairs, and it is this, by one ſole Negative Teſtimony, to endeavour to deſtroy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Affirmatives. They will ſay, I have asked a perſon that came from that Country, who hath ſaid that there is no ſuch thing, and the proof thereof is, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard it. Behold a great Marvel, that in a large Country, and in a place where there are multitudes of perſons ſcattered, ſome on one ſide, and ſome on the other, there ſhould be ſome of them that ſhould not ſee and hear that which thouſands of others did! Let any Man judge if it be juſt to call in doubt, that which a hundred Witneſſes have ſeen, for the ſake of one that affirms he did not ſee it. But it will be ſaid yet, that there are perſons in <hi>Switzerland</hi> that after they had ſaid they had heard the ſinging of Pſalms in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> had aft<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rwards retracted it. It is a matter of Fact that is told us here without any proof. But I am content at preſent to receive it as true. It is not a thing very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that a Man hearing ſpeak of a Prodigy which holds all minds in doubt and ſuſpence, ſhould boaſt to be of the Party, and cry with the croud, <hi>I ſaw it, I ſaw it.</hi> Theſe ſort of Affairs were never otherwiſe, a hundred falſe Witneſſes mingle themſelves with true ones, when the thing diſcovered is only matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and hear-ſay. And it is likewiſe very poſſible that ſome may return to their integrities, and confeſs that they ſaw nothing. But can this invalidate the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe which Perſevere, which Write, which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and which Sign with an Oath? Theſe Hiſtories being ſet in ſo much light, that it appears to me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently difficult to call them in doubt. I think it may be permitted us to draw ſome Concluſions from them.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49990:93"/>Some will be for us, others againſt us. Againſt us, for it is a reproach, that the Providence of God makes unto us, becauſe you have ſo eaſily ſuffered your mouths to be ſtopped, and becauſe you have not dared, nor been willing any more to ſing his Praiſes, and Songs of Thankſgiving, which are the Symbols of your Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. God has made mouths in the midſt of the Air, and he cauſes his Praiſes to proceed from Stones and Rocks. And don't ye doubt but Rocks, and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible mouths, will riſe in judgment againſt thoſe that fear Men, and will not glorifie God generouſly, and in the preſence of Perſecutors. The other Concluſions are for us, and againſt our Enemies. This event ſpeaks, and tells them <hi>if theſe hold their peace, the Stones will ſpeak.</hi> You ought to give thanks to God, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves your Worſhip by a Sign ſo conſiderable, and by a Teſtimony ſo evident. Let them not tell you that all this is nothing but deluſion; for all illuſions come from the Devil, who is the Father of lies, and who hath the Praiſes of God in horror and deteſtation. To conclude, behold the Event as a happy Preſage, that God will not ſuffer your Voices and your Songs to dye; the Angels have ſeized on them, and will ſhortly reſtore them, that you your ſelves may ſound them forth in the Air. You are obliged to make a great change in your life, that you may be worthy to receive this Grace from God. For which reaſon you ought to think of renouncing theſe worldly vanities of Cloaths, Cuſtoms, Words, Food, Houſes, Furniture, Pleaſures and Divertiſements; to take Sackcloth and Aſhes, to Cloath your ſelves with an Humility, and Modeſty truely Chriſtian. The time of your deliverance is at hand, but it will not come till that of your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath gone before it: the Spirit of Life will not return, till the Spirit of Piety and Devotion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entered into your ſouls.</p>

            <head>THE EIGHTH PASTORAL LETTER. Alterations happening during the Third Age. Concerning Baptiſm, Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE continue at this time the Hiſtory of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that happened in the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church. We are in the third Age thereof, we will divide what we have to tell you concerning this Age into three Letters, to the end that we may not overcharge your memory, and we will fill the Sheet with matters of Fact, reſpecting the Perſecution which you ſuffer, and whereof our Brethren from divers places have given us information. The Doctrine of the Church is a Flood which rolls and ſwells in rolling, it unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily gathers more of impurity than good things, we ſhall ſee it in the third Age. We have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Additions and Alterations in the Simplicity of the Chriſtian Worſhip arrived in the ſecond Age. We ſhall ſee many more in this.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the Sacraments, as we have done in the ſecond Age. The firſt of theſe Sacraments is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49990:94"/>Baptiſm, we have not obſerved by the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us they did adminiſter it, that there was made unto his time (that is to ſay, until the year 160. of our Lord) any conſiderable Addition. But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who wrote in the beginning of the third Age, about forty years after <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> learns us, that in his time they had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome Ceremonies to Baptiſm, that they gave Milk and Honey to the baptiſed, when they came out of the Baptiſmal Font. <hi>E fontibus egreſſi lact is &amp; mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis concordiam praeguſtant.</hi> During the ſpace of ſeven days after Baptiſm they abſtained from ordinary Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>i. e.</hi> from going unto the Baths, they added alſo an Unction of Oil after Baptiſm, and the Impoſition of Hands. <hi>Afterwards,</hi> ſays the ſame <hi>Tertullian, when we are gone out of the water we are anointed with the bleſſed Unction, according to the ancient Diſcipline by which they were accuſtomed to anoint the Prieſts with Oil, which they poured out of a Horn,</hi> &amp;c. As to what concerns the Impoſition of Hands, I believe ſufficiently, that it was a Ceremony not uſed in Baptiſm. For it has always been an Appendage of Prayer when they prayed for any one in particular, and demanded on his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the Spirit of God and his Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> does not ſay, that it was the cuſtom to kiſs thoſe perſons that were received to Baptiſm. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Anſwer of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fidus,</hi> that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was afterward introduced. This Biſhop <hi>Fidus</hi> made ſcruple to baptiſe Children before the eighth day, becauſe that before that day the Impurities which proceed from their Birth do not appear well wiped off. Thereupon S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells him: <hi>Concerning what you ſay, that a Child in the firſt days after his Birth is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear, and that every one of us have ſome abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to kiſs him: we do not think that that can be any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the giving of him Grace.</hi> In the mean while, as we find no Authors of this Age who ſpeak of this kiſs, as one of the Ceremonies of Baptiſm; ſo it is more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49990:95"/>probable, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks it with reſpect to the kiſs which the faithful gave each other before the Communion: For then they cauſed Infants to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate after their Baptiſm all together, after the ſame manner they did the adult; and before they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it was neceſſary that they ſhould ſalute them. The ſame S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks of certain poſſeſſed perſons, which they did efficaciouſly exorciſe in Baptiſm in ſuch a manner, that the Devils, which had reſiſted all kinds of Conjurations, gave place to the Sacramental Waters. But it does not appear, that this Exorciſm was, as at this day, a Ceremony practiſed in the Baptiſm of all Catechumens in whatſoever ſtate they were, nor did the Devil go out by virtue of any Exorciſm, but by the ſole virtue of the Baptiſmal Water ſprinkled on them. So that we ſee nothing added to Baptiſm in this third Age but Milk and Hony, which they cauſed the baptiſed to eat, and the Unction wherewithal they did anoint them when they came out of the Font.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ceremonies of Unction and Impoſition of Hands, which were of uſe in the third Age, do oblige us to obſerve here, that they were not at all the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrament of Confirmation, as they would ſince make us believe. It is true, they are that whereof the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have made their Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But it is falſe, that the Church did then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as a Sacrament. They were purely Ceremonies of Decency or Myſtery, which made up part of the Baptiſmal Adminiſtration.
<list>
                  <item>1. This appears becauſe this Unction and Impoſition of Hands was performed immediately after Baptiſm, this no Man diſputes. At this day Confirmation is deferred a long time after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and thouſands of perſons even amongſt the adult die without being confirmed.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſame Miniſter that had baptiſed was he that performed this Unction and Impoſition of Hands, whereas afterwards this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege was affected by, and appropriated to the Biſhop.</item>
                  <item>3. To conclude, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us expreſly, that this
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49990:95"/>Unction <hi>was in imitation of the ancient Jewiſh Diſcipline, according to which the Prieſts were anointed.</hi>

               </list> Which he would never have ſaid, if he had believed it a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian Church. For the Sacraments of the New Covenant derive their original from Jeſus Chriſt, and not from <hi>Moſes.</hi> 'Tis the opinion of the Learned Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> of the famous <hi>Grotius,.</hi> and of almoſt all the Learned that are unprejudiced, that theſe Ceremonies were Appendages of the Baptiſm of the Ancients, and that they were added in the ſecond and third Age.</p>
            <p>But it's of very little importance to know how the Ancients did conſider theſe Ceremonies of Unction and Impoſition of Hands, whether as Dependances of Baptiſm, or as Ceremonies ſeparate and diſtinct from it. It is ſufficient, that they did not conſider it as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament deſcended from Chriſt Jeſus; and that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who is the firſt in whom this Unction is obſerved, profeſſes that it is in imitation of Judaiſm, juſt in the ſame manner, as is the Impoſition of Hands. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, amongſt the Reformed, hath rejected this Unction, which makes the principal part of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, and has retained nothing but the Impoſition of Hands, to which ſhe hath left the Name of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. 'Tis an Eccleſiaſtical Ceremony, which ſhe might retain without crime, and which we might aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don without any prejudice to Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>We have learned that many of the new Converts, which have ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced, are very obſtinate and wilful thereupon <hi>(viz.)</hi> about the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Confirmation, about its antiquity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have rejected it; but they ought to know that we have renounced it:
<list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe they have made a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Sacrament thereof, whereas it was nothing but a Ceremony of human Inſtitution.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways permitted to reject thoſe obſervances which are of no neceſſity, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, at this day, does not practiſe the giving Hony and Milk to thoſe that are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49990:96"/>baptiſed, nor to forbid them bathing, during the ſpace of ſeven days: Unction is a Ceremony of no other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or importance than this.</item>
                  <item>3. To conclude, we have judged it to purpoſe to omit the Ceremony of Unction with the others, becauſe we were willing to reſtore the Chriſtian Worſhip to its ancient Simplicity.</item>
               </list> And it is certain, that theſe are Additions of the third Age.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore know, that the Chriſtians of the ſecond and third Age being diſguſted at the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Apoſtolick Worſhip, did blow up the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with Ceremonies that were added with intention to ſignifie the Grace that God did communicate and give there. They cauſed the new baptiſed to eat Wine and Milk, becauſe they were the nouriſhments of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and they would ſignifie, that Believers newly baptiſed, ought to be as Children new born. For which reaſon <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes the word <hi>infantare</hi> to deſign the Action, by which they made the new baptiſed to taſte Wine and Milk. They anointed them with Oil, to ſignifie that ſpiritual Unction of Grace which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers did receive, they laid hands on them to ſignifie the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt. The following Ages added Wax Candles and Torches to ſignifie ſpiritual Illuminations; white Garments to repreſent the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the newly baptiſed, and with the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion many other Ceremonies. But I know not how by an imagination which may be called rough and impoliſhed in a little time after the Inſtitution of theſe Ceremonies (which were not inſtituted by the Church but to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) Men came to believe they had the virtue to confer Grace. And of the divers Graces which are confirmed to the Believers in Baptiſm, they attribute one to the waſhing with Water, another to Unction, and another to Impoſition of Hands. They imagined, that the Water in Baptiſm did preciſely give the Remiſſion of Sins, that the Oil did beſtow the ſpiritual Unction, and that the Impoſition of Hands gave the Holy Ghoſt. This
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49990:96"/>Divinity is found in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the Book which he has left us concerning Baptiſm. Where he proves the Impoſition of Hands, after Baptiſm, cauſes the coming of the Holy Ghoſt; and he does it thus:
<list>
                  <item>1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prieſts and Magicians of Paganiſm did cauſe malignant Spirits to come upon their impure Waters by a Ceremony much like unto it.</item>
                  <item>2. Becauſe by the Impoſition of Hands, <hi>Jacob</hi> drew down a Bleſſing upon the Children of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>

                  <item>3. By the Figure of the Ark and Dove, who brought an Olive Branch from the the midſt of the Waters of the Deluge, wherein this Dove was a Figure of the Holy Ghoſt, which falls upon him that comes out of the Baptiſmal Waters.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who lived a little while after, taught the ſame thing <hi>(viz.)</hi> that Baptiſm gives forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>and that the Holy Spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Impoſition of Hands.</hi> But let it not offend theſe great Men, This Diſcourſe ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Age, and a perſon may ſee that it is a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which is deſcended from the Age of the Apoſtles, and from thoſe times in which extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit were communicated by the Impoſition of Hands. For will they ſay, that Remiſſion of Sins was given by the waſhing of Water, and the Holy Spirit by the Impoſition of Hands, is it to be thought, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their opinion, that ſanctifying Grace and the Spirit of Regeneration are not at all given in Baptiſm? No, on the contrary S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> lays it down in expreſs words, <hi>That the Spirit is received by Baptiſm.</hi> And in another place he does affirm, that ſanctifying Grace whole and entire is given in Baptiſm, and that Men augment or diminiſh it afterwards by the good or evil uſe that they make of it, there is therefore no need of a new Ceremony for the donation of the Holy Spirit. He himſelf teaches us whence the Church took that cuſtom of impoſing Hands after Baptiſm. 'Tis from the Action of the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who laid Hands on the People of <hi>Samaria,</hi> to the end, that they
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49990:97"/>might receive the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Which thing is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Thoſe that are baptiſed preſent themſelves to the Governors of the Church, and receive the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by our Prayer, and the Impoſition of Hands, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by the Seal of the Lord.</hi> The original of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> acknowledges, ought to have made him confeſs the inutility thereof in his Age, ſince they had no longer the power of communicating the miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>This Impoſition of Hands was an imitation of the Apoſtles ill underſtood, and Unction was alſo a pure Addition in this Age, the effect whereof they were very much perplexed to expreſs. They ſaid indeed this Unction was deſigned to give Grace; but what Grace ſince Baptiſm communicates it whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire? <hi>It is neceſſary,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Cyprian, that he who is baptiſed ſhould alſo be anointed, to the end, that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chriſm, that is to ſay, the Unction, he might be the anointed of God, and have in himſelf the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. Now the Euchariſt, and the Oil which they make uſe of to anoint the baptiſed, are ſanctified upon the Altar.</hi> It is clear by theſe words, that Unction is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Ceremony of Baptiſm, and that the Donation of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt is not attributed to it, but becauſe 'tis annexed to Baptiſm. For to give the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt is the proper effect of Baptiſm, according to all the Ancients. It ſeems by this Paſſage, that the Oil wherewith they anointed the baptiſed, was conſecrated Oil; for S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, <hi>It was conſecrated on the Altar.</hi> But this is not all; for the ſanctification of the Oil upon the Altar ſignifies no more than what we have obſerved concerning the ſecond Age. 'Twas that Believers brought Bread, Wine and Oil, and placed them upon the Holy Table. They conſecrated theſe Oblations by Prayer, and they ſerved themſelves of them for the Uſages of the Church: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, they ſerved themſelves of Oil for Lights, when they aſſembled by night, and for the Unction of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49990:97"/>the baptiſed. As to what remains you may obſerve, that in the third Age nothing was ſeen but one Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Baptiſm, whereas we ſhall find two after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Behold the Alterations which have happened to the Sacrament of Baptiſm in this Age. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Euchariſt.</p>
            <p>We have obſerved, that in the ſecond Age they had added the mixture of Water with Wine, the Cuſtom of ſending it to the abſent by the Deacons, and above all they had there annexed the Oblation of thoſe Gifts that Believers made on the Altar, as a part of the Ceremony. This had already given it the appearance of a Sacrifice, and indeed gave the name to the whole Action. We ſhall not need to doubt, but this imagination increaſed with time, Chriſtians having a very great deſire to give to their Worſhip ſome appearance of a Sacrifice, to take away the ſcandal which the Pagans conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. For they perpetually ſaid to Chriſtians, <hi>You have no Temples, Statues, Altars, nor Sacrifices, and by conſequence you are impious.</hi> There was nothing in the Worſhip of the Chriſtian Religion which might be dreſſed up in the likeneſs of a Sacrifice, but the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. They had that reſpect for the converted Pagans, that they added as many innocent Ceremonies as they could, to give to this Sacrament the appearance of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, with the ſame intention they gave it the name, with this intention, to the firſt Oblation uſed in the ſecond Age, they added another. And they began to preſent to God by Prayer the Bread and Wine they were about to conſecrate, and wherewith they made the Euchariſt. This is called Oblation and Sacrifice. The Writings of the third Age are full thereof. And 'tis from thence, that Popery would draw ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as if they found therein their Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Living and the Dead. But this pretence is falſe, for firſt of all it muſt be obſerved, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſays expreſly, that 'tis a Sacrifice of Bread and Wine; we ſhall hear afterwards the Fathers of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49990:98"/>fourth Age, and thoſe following. At preſent we are to hear thoſe of the third, <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſays that Melchiſedec <hi>gave Bread and Wine, as ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Proviſions, in Type of the Euchariſt.</hi> Which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> explains in theſe words, <hi>Our Lord hath offered to God the ſame Sacrifice that</hi> Melchiſedec <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is to ſay Bread and Wine,</hi> viz. <hi>his Body and his Blood. We ſee,</hi> ſays he farther, <hi>the Sacrament of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our Lord prefigured in the Prieſt</hi> Melchiſedec, <hi>according to what the Scripture teſtifies,</hi> where it ſays Melchiſedec <hi>brought forth Bread and Wine.</hi> And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle below, <hi>The Lord accompliſhing, and rendering perfect the image of his Sacrifice, hath offered Bread and Wine.</hi> Now, who ever heard ſay that there were Propitiatory Sacrifices of Bread aad Wine? All propitiation is in the effuſion of blood, and death of the Sacrifice. 2. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is certain that the Fathers of the third Age cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Euchariſt a Sacrifice, becauſe it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Sacrifice of the Croſs. <hi>We make mention of the Paſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all our Sacrifices,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> 3. We have yet an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, that the Fathers of the third Age did not look upon the Euchariſt as a true Sacrifice, from the manner in which they anſwered the Pagans, upon the reproach which they continually offered to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no Sacrifices. In the ſecond Age, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Prayers and Thankſgivings of Saints and Believers, were the only Sacrifices which were perfect, and acceptable to God, and were the only Sacrifices which Chriſtians have learnt to Offer, even then when they celebrated the Euchariſt.</hi> In truth this Author had loſt either his underſtanding or his memory, if the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt it ſelf had been a Propitiatory Sacrifice. <hi>Athena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> who lived in the ſame Age, anſwered alſo the Pagans after the ſame manner. <hi>What have I to do with Sacrifices and Burnt Offerings, ſince God cares not for them? He demands an unbloody Sacrifice, a reaſonable Service.</hi> Can any thing be more expreſs, and more lovely than
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49990:98"/>that which <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> ſays, in anſwer to a Pagan, that objected to him, The <hi>Chriſtians have no Temples nor Altars, do you think that we hide what we adore, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that we have no Temples nor Altars? The Sacrifice that ought to be offered to God, is a good Mind, a pure Conſcience, a ſincere Faith, it is to live Innocently, exerciſe Juſtice, abſtain from Evil, and prevent his Neighbour from Periſhing, this is to Sacrifice a fat Victim, theſe are our Sacrifices, this is our Service. Origen</hi> anſwers abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely after the ſame manner, to the Objection which was made by the Pagan <hi>Celſus.</hi> If we read <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he expreſſes himſelf almoſt in the ſame words. <hi>Arnobius</hi> producing the Objection of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, How then will ſome ſay, that you are under no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to offer Sacrifice?</hi> And anſwers after a manner very exact, <hi>We are not at all obliged thereunto. Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> anſwers no otherwiſe than thoſe which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now it is a prodigious blindneſs in theſe Men not to have anſwered the Pagans: <hi>You deceive your ſelves, we have a Sacrifice, and the moſt glorious of all Sacrifices. For we offer the Body of Jeſus Chriſt as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitatory Sacrifice to God, his Father.</hi> I intreat you, my Brethren, preſs your Converters, and demand of them whether they dare ſay to a Pagan, we have no other Sacrifices than Prayers and Thankſgivings, as for true Sacrifices we have no need to offer them.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, my Brethren, give attention to this laſt proof, that the Ancients of the third Age, did not account the Euchariſt a true Sacrifice. It is that they Conſecrated, and Celebrated this Sacrament out of Churches, in private Houſes, and at their Meals, beſides their ſolemn Communions, which were made in publick Aſſemblies, they Celebrated the Myſteries in private, and among their Domeſticks. This we ſee in a Letter of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he diſputes againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons who out of Mortification, and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from Wine, eſpecially in the morning, will not Celebrate the Euchariſt but with Water. <hi>Let not any
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49990:99"/>one,</hi> ſays he, <hi>flatter himſelf with this conſideration, that although in the mornings they offer with Water alone, nevertheleſs when they come to Supper, they offer the Cup mixed with Wine and Water. For when we eat this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we cannot call together all our people, to Celebrate this Sacrament in all its truth, in the preſence of all our Brethren.</hi> His ſence is, theſe Water drinkers, againſt whom he diſputes, did not ſatisfie the Commandment and Inſtitution of Chriſt Jeſus, to Celebrate with Wine, by theſe private Communions which were made in Houſes, in which they mingled Wine with Water, becauſe they ought to follow the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and to Celebrate the Sacrament in its purity, and integrity, in the preſence of all the Brethren, and in the midſt of publick Aſſemblies. It appears then from thence,
<list>
                  <item>1. That they Celebrated it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes in the Evening when they Supped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                  <item>2. That they there Conſecrated the Cup, and that it was not brought from <hi>Elce,</hi> where,</item>
                  <item>3. That the Bread, as well as the Cup, was Conſecrated at the ſame inſtant, for why ſhould they Conſecrate the Cup, if they had not power to Conſecrate the Bread?</item>
                  <item>4. To conclude, theſe Communions were private amongſt a few-perſons, and out of the preſence of the people.</item>
               </list> I do not doubt at all but it is of theſe private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks in Chap. 3. of his Book concerning <hi>The Soldiers Crown. We take,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Sacrament of the Euchariſt at Meal-time, as alſo at Morning Aſſemblies before day, where we do not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate but at the hand of the Preſidents.</hi> It is a paſſage that Men do not, or will not underſtand. For the underſtanding of it, we muſt know that <hi>Tertullian</hi> made this Book on the occaſion of a Chriſtian Soldier, who would not ſet a Crown of leaves upon his Head, becauſe it was forbidden to Chriſtians. By this refuſal he diſcovered he was a Chriſtian, and expoſes himſelf to Martyrdom, which he ſuffering, many blamed him, and ſaid, why did he refuſe to bear his Crown on his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49990:99"/>Head, where is the Text of Scripture that forbids it? <hi>Tertullian</hi> anſwers, that though it was not written, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Soldier had done well, becauſe when we diſpute concerning Cuſtoms, Tradition without Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is ſufficient to Eſtabliſh them, and he proves it by the Trine Immerſion in Baptiſm, which was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as alſo by the Milk and Hony that they gave to the new Baptiſed. Among the obſervances which had not been commanded, and in which they did a little deviate from the firſt inſtitution, he puts the Cuſtom of receiving the Euchariſt in the Morning, <hi>in Aſſemblies before day,</hi> as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls them. And he pretends that the Cuſtom of taking the Euchariſt at Meal-time, is that alone which Jeſus Chriſt hath commanded, that is to ſay, hath Authorized by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: from whence it is clear he makes two ſorts of Celebration of this Myſtery, the one Solemn, which was done in their night Aſſemblies, the other private, that every Family did in their own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Now it is to be obſerved, That in theſe Domeſtick Euchariſts, it was the Maſter of the Houſe, or of the Feaſt, that did Celebrate, that did Conſecrate and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute. This is clear by a paſſage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> where endeavouring to prove ſecond Marriages unlawful to all ſorts of perſons, and not only to Prieſts and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Altar, he ſays that all Believers are Prieſts, that all Celebrate, that all Baptiſe, and by conſequence they are obliged by the Law which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids ſecond Marriages to Prieſts and Presbyters. <hi>We deceive our ſelves very much,</hi> ſays he, <hi>if we imagin that what is forbidden to Prieſts, is permitted to Laicks, for are they not all Prieſts? It is written he hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father. It is the Authority of the Church which hath put a difference between the Clergy and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he People, and which hath eſtabliſhed this ſacred honor for the body of the Clergy, this is ſo true, that when there <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s no Clergy-man in a place, thou doſt Celebrate, thou doſt Baptiſe, and thou art to thy ſelf a Prieſt: now where
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49990:100"/>there are three, there is a Church, though they be Laicks, for every one lives by his own Faith, and God has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard at all to perſons.</hi> Here are divers things which are contrary to falſe Principles that have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ſome time ſince. Firſt of all, In this time it was not believed that the diſtinction of Laity and Clergy, and with much more reaſon that of Prieſt and Biſhop, was by Divine right. It was the Church, and poſitive Law, made this difference. 2. Every one for himſelf, and for thoſe that were his might exerciſe the Miniſtry. 3. And above all, All might Baptiſe, and Conſecrate, and Adminiſter the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. <hi>Offers &amp; tingis,</hi> you Laicks <hi>Adminiſter the Euchariſt, and you do alſo Baptiſe,</hi> that is to ſay in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes. For as to publick Aſſemblies which met before day, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that they did not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in them, <hi>but from the hand of the Preſidents:</hi> that is to ſay, from the hand of Biſhops, or Prieſts, which were preſent. In which he inſinuates clearly enough, that out of theſe publick Aſſemblies they Communicated by the hand of Laicks. And I my ſelf do not doubt, but that this Cuſtom continued in ſome places, even till St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> time; who aſſures us that in his time they Communicated after Supper the <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> although on all other days of the year they thought it neceſſary to Communicate in the morning, and before they had eaten. And it was the Head of the Family that Adminiſtred the Sacrament on that day, in memory of the firſt Communion, where Jeſus Chriſt, as Father of the Family, diſtributed the Holy Bread to his Diſciples. The ſame thing was done alſo in the Churches near to Alexandria, and in <hi>Thebais,</hi> according to the Teſtimony of <hi>Socrates.</hi> We conclude at preſent from hence two things,
<list>
                  <item>1. That in the third Age they did not look upon the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt as a true Sacrifice, for would they have permitted every private perſon to Communicate among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whilſt they were eating at the Table amongſt
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49990:100"/>their Domeſticks? Sacrifices are not offered but in Temples, and upon Altars.</item>
                  <item>2. That according to the Chriſtians of the third Age, Oblations, Liturgies, and other Ceremonies, were not conſidered but as parts of Decency, and by no means as things that were of the Eſſence, and of neceſſity in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: for in theſe Domeſtick Communions all this was omitted, they practiſed nothing but Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Fraction, and Manducation of the Bread, it was nevertheleſs a true Euchariſt.</item>
                  <item>3. We conclude a third thing by the way, it is that there is no need of Miſſion, nor Vocation, for the Adminiſtration of Holy things, and by conſequence thoſe people who trouble us ſo violently about the Vocation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and our own, have no foundation for it in any Law, Divine or Apoſtolick.</item>
               </list> We will here conclude what we are willing to ſay, at this time, concerning the Chriſtianity of the third Age, we will add divers things for your Edification and Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>☞ Firſt of all it has been judged convenient to let you underſtand what is the fidelity and honeſty of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and your Converters, on the Subject of the means wherewith they ſerve themſelves to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert you. It has been thought fit I ſay, to inform you, that we have received Letters from the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi> which do fully confute, what the Biſhop of the Dioceſs has dared to publiſh in his Paſtoral Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Reformed of that Country had not heard of any torments. There is a Letter dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 15. 1685. that ſays, <hi>We are in confuſion, Pray to God for us, the Dragoons are at</hi> Meaux, <hi>after they had cauſed all the Country of</hi> Claye <hi>to change their Religion, nothing ſtands before them, behold the pitiable ſtate whereunto our ſins have brought us.</hi> In another Letter of <hi>January</hi> 3. it is thus, <hi>In the confuſion wherein we are, what ſhall I ſay to you? I am not able to ſpeak to you but with tears of blood, the Dragoons have made all to change by force in the Provinces of</hi> Meaux <hi>and</hi> Soiſſons. Another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49990:101"/>of <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. from the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the violences that were offered to a venerable old Man, <hi>de la Ferte au Col,</hi> of the Age of ſeventy eight years, called M. <hi>de Monceaux,</hi> Dr. in Phyſick. The Archers came to carry him away in the midſt of Winter, and without giving him one days reſpite, they carried him away by force. When he was in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Woods he fell into ſo great weakneſs and faintneſs, that he reſolved to caſt himſelf down in the mire, and dye there, but they would not do him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to let him dye in peace. They tempted him by all ſorts of methods, and in concluſion being able to again nothing upon him, they choſe to impriſon him with very many others. I do profeſs that reading the Paſtoral Letter of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> I was tempted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Reformed of his Dioceſs had all fallen only under the fear of evil, for I was not able to imagin that any one ſhould write falſely concerning a matter of Fact, whereof there are thirty or forty thouſand Witneſſes. But behold the Letters which teach us what we ought to believe concerning it. There are others by which it appears that all thoſe Violences have been done in the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi> which have been committed elſewhere. It is alſo known by an Eye-witneſs, that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> himſelf made uſe of the Kings Declaration to prevail with a ſick perſon to Communicate, which Declaration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, that thoſe who do not Communicate in their ſickneſs, ſhall be ſent to the Gallies if they recover their health.</p>
            <p>Theſe things which precede are not reported but accidentally, for we do not make it our duty to report to you the Violences and Cruelties that have been done, and which ſhall be done, if it be not in ſuch degree and meaſure, as ſhall be neceſſary to give you example of the courage and ſtrength of our Martyrs. For the deſign that we have in theſe Letters is not to irritate and provoke you againſt your Perſecutors, but
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49990:101"/>to comfort and edifie you by the conſtancy of thoſe which Suffer. Upon this conſideration, and with this intention, we will report ſome Hiſtories which have been communicated to us, which will learn you, that thanks be to God, our Enemies have not accompliſhed the cruel deſign which they had formed againſt us, which was to hinder us from having Martyrs.</p>
            <p>We ought not to refuſe this Name, and Honor, to thoſe which after they had been ſo weak as to ſign I know not what form of Abjuration of our Religion, have had the courage to raiſe themſelves, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere even unto death in the profeſſion of the Truth. We owe alſo the ſame honor to thoſe which are dead amidſt the torments, which the Dragoons, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors have inflicted on them, and which have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered even to the laſt breath in the bold profeſſion of the Truth. To conclude, it ſeems to me that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extending the ſignification of the word Martyr too far, we may give it to thoſe, who after ſuffering long and cruel torments, have ſeen death as very near them, and have beheld it as certain, without being the leaſt ſhaken thereby. So that without reckoning thoſe that are dead by the hand of the Hangman, or by the Sword of the Soldier, formerly for the ſake of Religion; behold three ſorts of Martyrs, whereof we ought to have ſome eſtimation, and of every one of theſe three Orders, we will repoot unto to ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which have been writ unto us.</p>
            <p>An Eye-Witneſs hath written to us, that in a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Poictou,</hi> called Gods Town <hi>Dannai,</hi> an honeſt Man called M. <hi>Palmenteir,</hi> after having ſuffered all the firſt violences by the Dragoons, to wit Blaſphemies, Threatnings, Plundering of all his Goods, and other things of like nature, not yielding was treated as you ſhall underſtand, and in concluſion dyed amidſt the torments. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> returning from the Aſſembly of the <hi>Clergy</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> about the end of the month <hi>September</hi> in the year paſt, comes into
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49990:102"/>the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>Palmenteir,</hi> and asked the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons why they had done their duty no better, and whether there were no fire to warm this Gouty old Man? After he had given this order, he went up the Chamber on high, and the Dragoons dragged the weak old Man out of his Bed, full of the Gout for many years. They dragged him on the floor, they applied an Iron Plate red hot to the bottom of his Feet, and to his Hands. In this torment he uttered dreadful cries; the Archbiſhop in the Chamber above laughed at it, and diverted himſelf with it. The Wife of the ſaid <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteir</hi> came to the ſuccour of her Husband, they knocked her down with blows of their Daggers, and the butt end of their Piſtols: ſhe fell-into a Swoon. In this eſtate they bathed her with two or three Buckets of Water. This puniſhment being indured a long time, this poor Man was ſo weak, not to Abjure his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to promiſe to uſe means for his inſtruction and information. The Archbiſhop deſired at leaſt, that he would ſign this promiſe, but the condition his hands were in not permitting him to move them, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop ſigned for him, and ſent the writing to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Poicters,</hi> intreating him to ſend Miſſionaries to Convert this Family. This poor ſick perſon had no ſooner conſented to this Signature, but he retracted it, and cauſed a perſon to write to the Biſhops that he had no need of inſtruction, and would dye in his Religion. In the mean time the Wounds of his burning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was covered all over, grew to inflammation, and reſiſted all remedies, a Fever joyns it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and he dyed within a few days after, bewailing without ceaſing his weakneſs, and repeating every moment thoſe words of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner,</hi> and repelling couragiouſly the temptations of a <hi>Carmelite,</hi> and a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> which perſecuted him to the laſt breath. I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the honor of Martyrdom to this Man, ſince he dyed confeſſing the name of God amidſt the cruel
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49990:102"/>Wounds, that had been given him, becauſe he would not abjure it.</p>
            <p>We ought not to refuſe a place in the Catalogue of our Martyrs to M. <hi>de Villiers,</hi> a younger Brother, of the Houſe <hi>Juigne,</hi> a Family ſufficiently known. This Gentleman was arreſted at <hi>Francy,</hi> near to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſave himſelf by flight. They carried him to <hi>Calice,</hi> from whence the Intendant ſent him to <hi>Paris</hi> by the Provoſt, where he was put in priſon in <hi>Biſhop-Fort,</hi> there he continued from <hi>Jan.</hi> 8. till the 22. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt. During the whole time of his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he preached by his actions and words, after a manner the moſt efficacious in the world. He was both Learned and Pious, that he confounded all the Converters, after a manner that edified the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, which ſuffered for the ſame Cauſe. The chief Preſident took the pains one day to come and ſee him. They entered into Diſcourſe; but there was found that inequality betwixt him and Monſieur <hi>de Villiers,</hi> that he was conſtrained to leave him, ſaying what formerly a Cardinal ſaid to <hi>Arioſto,</hi> on occaſion of his Poem, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Orlando Furioſo, Oh God! where have you gotten ſo much Roguery?</hi> An Anſwer well worthy the Gravity of a chief Magiſtrate, about ſo ſerious an Affair. M. <hi>de Villiers</hi> had to do with all ſorts of perſons; Men of the Church, and Men of the Sword aſſaulted him, and he diſingaged himſelf from all their Attacks, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with an admirable ſucceſs. The inconveniences of the Priſon cauſed him to fall into a Bloody Flux, whereof he died at the end of ſix weeks. During his Sickneſs they denyed him all commerce, with the other Priſoners of his own Religion, he ſaw none but Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors and Tempters. But nevertheles it was known by themſelves, that he never ceaſed to praiſe God, and to bleſs him, that he died in and for the Defence of his Truth and Goſpel; his Soul was always raiſed towards Heaven, his Diſcourſes were full of Piety, Diſingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the World, and of ardent Deſires for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49990:103"/>
I have told you already, that I do not believe, that we ought to refuſe the Glory of Martyrdom to thoſe who, through weakneſs, made their Subſcriptions. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs without partaking in any Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did afterwards recover, and die between the fear of being ſent to the Gallies, if they returned to health, and the horror of being dragged all naked upon a Hurdle after their Death. This Fear and the Horror are true Puniſhments, ſo that I reckon thoſe Women, which ſurmount the horror of nakedneſs, to which their dead Bodies were to be expoſed after death, as dying in the midſt of Torments for the Faith. Nothing makes a more violent impreſſion on the Spirit of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Woman. And all the World knows the Hiſtory of the Chriſtian Damoſels, which were cured of a certain melancholick Diſtemper, which put them upon hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves. Nothing could give check to this rage. In concluſion, they thought it adviſeable to draw ſome of them ſtark naked through the Streets in the view of the People. The fear of being thus proſtituted to the Eyes of Men, ſtaid others, and hindered them from being their own Executioners.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort of Martyrs we have an infinite number. For of all the new Converts which are dead in great numbers within a year paſt, particularly in <hi>Poytou,</hi> where by a juſt Judgment of God Death hath made ſuch Spoils, that great Pariſhes are intirely depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all theſe new Converts. I ſay there are not, it may be, one of an hundred which have given way to their Threatnings, and permitted themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate after the <hi>Roman</hi> Manner. Thus 'tis alſo in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> there have been Women which they have affrighted with this puniſhment. But they anſwered courageouſly, that what they threatened as an evil, they deſired as an advantage, and that they would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this ſhame which they prepared for them to their Saviour, as an Expiation of their Crime. This great Reſignator has not at all mollified the rage of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49990:103"/>At <hi>Montpellier</hi> hath been ſeen the Body of a venerable Woman, named <hi>Mademoiſelle Cauquet,</hi> Wife of M. <hi>Samuel Cauquet,</hi> a Phyſician, expoſed all naked through the Streets, beſmearing the Pavement with her Blood and Entrails poured out thereon. And when ſhe was left at the Dunghil, there came two Dragoons, which cauſed their Horſes to paſs and repaſs over this poor body an hundred times. But that which is moſt edifying, is to know, that during her Sickneſs, the Anſwers that this holy Woman made to her Judges, and which are mentioned in her proceſs, bear the marks of a profound humility, and of an extraordinary good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It may be they may be found one day in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, if the malice of the Devil does not cauſe thoſe precious Monuments to be ſuppreſſed, as they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt intirely blotted out the Procedures againſt the ancient <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> to the end that the proofs of their Innocency might be all made void. We have ſeen the Carcaſe of one named <hi>Peter Crouſel,</hi> the Son of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of <hi>Clermont</hi> of <hi>Lodeve,</hi> dying a Confeſſor in the City of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> dragged at a Horſes Tail, and a Priſoner taken from the ſame Priſon where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr died, leading the Horſe, and a Hangman ſtriking the Body of the living perſon more frequently than the Horſe which dragged the dead.</p>
            <p>The number of this kind of Martyrs being ſo great, we cannot make a Catalogue of them, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of thoſe which are ſcattered in divers places in <hi>France,</hi> and have been eye-witneſſes thereof. I will only report here two, which are more particularly come to my knowledge, and which have ſomething peculiar in them, becauſe of the Quality of the Perſons. The firſt is M. <hi>Robert d' Ully,</hi> Vicount <hi>d' Nouion,</hi> of the Church of <hi>Couci</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> an old Gentleman of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighty years of age, who had been Maſter of Camp to a Regiment of Infantry, and Governor of a place called <hi>La Motte au Bois,</hi> all covered with Wounds and Scars that he had received in the Service
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49990:104"/>of the King, during forty years ſpace, and having yet a Bullet in his Knee, which could not be taken thence. This old Man was ſo weak, as to make his Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as many others did; but he had alſo the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to retract it not only by word of mouth, but alſo by a Writing ſigned with his own hand. They cauſed a Hangman with a Hurdle to come before his door, and told him he muſt be dragged. M. <hi>de Novion</hi> told them, that they ſhould not tarry for him, for he was ready to go to the place of Execution. He aroſe from his Bed, altho he had not been able to walk for many years; the Provoſt being aſtoniſhed at this conſtancy, paid the Hangman and others for their Journey, and ſent them back. This Gentleman a few days after was dragged from his Houſe, and put into a Convent of the Order of the Premonſtrants, where the Monks diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelves ſo well of the Commiſſion, that they killed him by haraſſing him without ceaſing. They made him loſe his Voice many days before he loſt his Life, by ſpeaking eagerly to him, and he repelling them with vehemence. He died, continually thruſting them from him with his hand, and lifting up his Hands and Eyes to Heaven, when he was no longer able to lift his Voice thither. As ſoon as he was dead the Monks cauſed his Body to be caſt into a Dog's Kennel, and gave notice thereof to the chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Couci;</hi> he came and cauſed his Body, without ſo much as a Shirt, to be laid upon a Cart to carry it to that City. A frightful Spectacle was there ſeen, the Head of this poor Man hung out of the Cart all bloody. All the Wounds that he had formerly received reopened all at once, and became ſo many mouths, which vomited Blood, and demanded Vengeance, that after ſo long Services they were ſo rewarded. When the Body was arrived at <hi>Couci,</hi> they caſt it, in this condition, into the Sink of the Priſon, they cauſed his Bowels to be torn out by a Chirurgeon, they threw them to Dogs upon the Walls of the City. This Body lying in the dirt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49990:104"/>ſome weeks, expecting that his Proceſs would be made. At the end of fifteen days Sentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and executed, the Carcaſe was drawn through all the Streets of the City: and in concluſion, thrown into the Ditch, whither the Rabble went, and pelted it with Stones, till they left not one whole Bone; and for fear leſt any one ſhould take him by night, and bury him, they ſet a Sentinel upon the Wall of the City for many nights together near the place where they had caſt him. And they added a Prohibition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of death, that no Body ſhould bury him, ſo that there he is to be eaten of Dogs, if it be not done already.</p>
            <p>To this Martyr ſo famous in the Wars, we will joyn M. <hi>Paul Cheneuix,</hi> famous in the long Robe, Dean of the Counſellors of the Parliament of <hi>Metts,</hi> more than eighty years of age, and who had ſate upon the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> from the <hi>35<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
               </hi> year of his age. This vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old Man died about the end of <hi>November,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever having communicated, begging pardon of God for his weakneſs, confounding the Prieſts and the Biſhop of <hi>Metts,</hi> the Governor, the Procurator of the King, and the principal Members of Parliament, which urged him vehemently by Threatnings, lewd Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Argumentations. When he was dead his Body was carried to the Priſon in his own Coach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the chief Magiſtrate to be drawn upon a Hurdle. The Parliament, who had ſome horror to ſee the moſt ancient Member of their Body thus treated, ſuſpended the execution of the Sentence. But an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came from the Court to execute it, and 'twas done the <hi>28th.</hi> of the laſt month. This venerable Body was ſtripped ſtark naked, without the leaſt covering for its ſhameful parts, they dragged it with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, all the Militia was put in Arms, and the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf was armed. The People at this Spectacle ſent forth Cryes that pierced the Heavens; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of <hi>Metts</hi> did an Action of Courage, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49990:105"/>ought to be immortalized; when the Body was on the Dunghil, they took it thence, and interred it honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with a train of 400 perſons, they did the ſame to a little Coffin wherein they had incloſed his Bowels, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dunghil they ſang <hi>Pſalm</hi> 79.2. <hi>The bodies of thy ſaints moſt dear, Abroad to birds they caſt: The fleſh of them that do thee fear, The beaſts devour and waſte.</hi> A few days before they exerciſed the ſame cruelty in the ſame City of <hi>Metts,</hi> upon the Body of a Man named <hi>Robert a Knacker,</hi> a poor Man for his quality, but whoſe Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage appeared heroical, during a ſickneſs of many days, in which he rejected with very great conſtancy and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility all thoſe temptations, which without ceaſing were offered to him. I do not report this with intent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce horror upon your minds for inhumanities ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, but to the end that you may learn, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt God has given the Crown of Martyrdom to Souls whoſe Bodies have ſuffered ſo many reproaches, and to have opportunity to conjure you to deſpiſe the like outrages which are prepared for your Bodies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you take care to put your Souls in a ſtate of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and in the way to Glory by a holy and ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

               <hi>The Ninth PASTORAL LETTER.</hi> A Continuation of the Alterations happening in the Chriſtian Church during the Third Age. Concerning Maſſes for the Dead, the communicating of Infants, the Real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE told you in the laſt of our Letters, that we ſhould divide the third Age, at leaſt, into three parts, to the end, that we may not charge your Memories with too many things at once; we have
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49990:105"/>found ſome Additions made to the Ceremonies of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and ſome in thoſe of the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt. The moſt notable Additions are Offerings, and Prayers for the dead, which are added in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which concerns the celebration of this Sacrament. Look to this point, there is a ſnare laid for you. In the Extracts, which your Converters make for you from the Fathers, of the third Age, they will ſhew you ſome Paſſages of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where they ſpeak <hi>of Oblations for the dead, of performing Sacrifice for the dead, and of deſiring refreſhment for the dead.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they cry boldly and ſay, Behold the Sacrifice of the Maſs and Purgatory at the ſame time; for this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is that of the Maſs; theſe dead for which they pray are the Souls in Purgatory, and this refreſhment which they beg for them is the deliverance of Souls out of that Fire. But theſe Men which inſtruct you are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant Sots, which never ſaw the Fathers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in little Extracts; or elſe they are Knaves, which cheat and deceive you. For behold the Truth pure and entire as it is.</p>
            <p>So it is, that in the beginning of the third Age, or juſt at the end of the ſecond they began to pray for the dead; the moſt ancient Writer which ſpeaks thereof is <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who died in the year 217. Secondly, 'tis to be obſerved, that the Prayers, in favour of whomſoever made, and for whatſoever it was, were put into the Liturgy of the Celebration of the Euchariſt, becauſe the Ancients were perſuaded, that Prayers joyned to this Sacrament, which is the Commemoration of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, were much more efficacious, and acceptable to Almighty God. So that thoſe who recommended themſelves to the Prayers of the Church did carry, or cauſe to be carried, their Names to the Paſtors, to the end, that they might inſert them into thoſe places of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, where they prayed God on the behalf of particular perſons. And 'tis from thence came the cuſtom of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Maſſes for all perſons and all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49990:106"/>
Thoſe that deſire that they ſhould pray for their dead did not fail to bring their Names, and cauſe them to be inſerted in their Liturgy.</p>
            <p>Now it muſt be remembred, that it was the cuſtom of Chriſtians from the firſt Age to bring their Alms and Offerings to the Holy Table. Before the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt they conſecrated theſe Offerings by Prayer, and the Names of thoſe which had offered them were mentioned therein.</p>
            <p>When the cuſtom of praying for the dead was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the Kindred which deſired that they ſhould pray for their dead, brought Offerings according to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. They declared, that theſe Oblations or Alms were made by the order of the dead, or that of their Relations, to the end that they would pray for them, and that mention might be made of them in their Liturgy, and in their Prayers. And thoſe Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Alms are called Oblations for the dead.</p>
            <p>And as thoſe Offerings which are made by the living, have given the Name of Oblation to all the Action of the Sacrament: ſo theſe Oblations made for the dead, to the end they might pray for them, give the name of <hi>Sacrifice for the dead</hi> to all the Prayers made for them in the Celebrations of the Myſteries.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it muſt be known, that the Church of the firſt Age, which had a reſpect (it may be exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive) for the memory of the Martyrs, cauſed their Names to be regiſtred in the Liturgy of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, particularly in the Celebration of the Myſteries, which were performed on the day of their Martyrdom, which was called the Birth-Day of the Martyr, and this was alſo called Oblations for the dead: <hi>We offer every year on the day of the Death of a Martyr Oblations for the dead,</hi> ſaith <hi>Teruillian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold from whence comes Maſſes for the dead, and the ſhadow of reſemblance with what is done in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is capable of dazling ye. But obſerve theſe great Differences. The firſt is that the Sacrifices
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49990:106"/>that were offered for the dead (ſo they call them) were not accounted true Sacrifices, much leſs propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifices. 2. That they did not beg of God delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the pains of Purgatory. For Purgatory was not known at that time. The third is that they did not commemorate Saints and Martyrs as they do at this day, to have part in their Merits, or to offer their Merits to God.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all it is indiſputable, that the Church of the third Age did not think, that Prayers for the dead joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt were a true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, I will not repeat the proofs, thoſe that pleaſe may ſee them in the preceding Letters. For ſince we have proved, that they did not at all account the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt in general a true Sacrifice, altho they gave it that name, tis clear, that they could not account as a true Sacrifice the Prayers which were joyned to the Euchariſt for the repoſe of the dead. So that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did not call that part of their Worſhip, which they called <hi>Oblations for the dead, Sacrifice,</hi> for any other reaſon, than becauſe the Offerings which were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated upon the holy Table, were there placed on the behalf of the dead, either by their order, or according to their will and intention. And becauſe theſe Prayers for the dead were joyned to the Sacrament, which is a Sacrifice of Praiſe, and the Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the propitiatory Sacrifice of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſay, that the end for which they make mention of the dead in the Celebration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, was not for deliverance from Purgatory, whereof no Diſcourſe had been yet heard. To be aſſured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there needs no more than to hear the Ancients concerning it. 1. At the beginning they were only ſimple Commemorations of the dead, to give thanks that they died in the Lord, and in the fear of God. 'Twas wholly to this end that they made mention of the Martyrs. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaking of two Men of War who had ſuffered death, ſays, that they were true and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49990:107"/>ſpiritual Soldiers of Jeſus Chriſt, and that in overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Devil by the Confeſſion of the name of Jeſus Chriſt. They had by a generous ſuffering been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive the Palms and Crowns of the Lord. <hi>Now you may remember,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that we offer Sacrifices for them.</hi> Obſerve, the S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays expreſly, that theſe two Martyrs were crowned in Heaven. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſays that they offered Sacrifice for them; therefore it was not to fetch them from Purgatory. How could it be that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the Ancients ſhould offer a Sacrifice to fetch the Martyrs from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, when they believed they were in a ſtate of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs? 'Twas to do an injury to Martyrs, to pray for them, ſay they, according to that ſaying ſo much known among the Ancients, <hi>Injuriam facit Martyri qui orat pro Martyre.</hi> For 'twas to doubt of his happineſs. The ſame S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays in another place: <hi>Obſerve well the days on which they died,</hi> ſpeaking of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, <hi>to the end that we may remember them when we ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Memories of the Martyrs. Altho</hi> Terullian, <hi>our moſt faithful and devout Brother hath written to us, and doth write to inform us of the days in which our bleſſed Brethren, which were in Priſon, paſſed to a glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, to the end that we may here celebrate Oblations and Sacrifices for their Memory, expecting, that with the help of God we ſhall celebrate them with you.</hi> That which he calls in the beginning <hi>Remembring the Martyrs,</hi> he calls afterwards <hi>Oblations and Sacrifices for the memory of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if to the Commemorations, that is to ſay, to the Praiſes which they gave to God for the glorious death of the departed, they added ſome Prayers to God, it was with reſpect to the Opinions then prevailing, touching the ſtate of Souls after death. And theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions were ſuch as had their Birth in the end of the ſecond Age, and was almoſt generally eſtabliſhed and received in the third.
<list>
                  <item>1. That Souls did not enter into the Heavenly Paradiſe till after the Reſurrection.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49990:107"/>
2. That they remained in a ſeparate place and ſtate, till that day.</item>
                  <item>3. That they might go thence ſooner or later, by a quicker or ſlower Reſurrection; for they thought that the Reſurrection was not accompliſhed in a day, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſpace of a thouſand years, at many and divers times.</item>
                  <item>4. That at the day of Judgment the Souls paſs through that fire which ſhall conſume the World.</item>
                  <item>5. That in concluſion, they preſent themſelves in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either to be Abſolved, or Condemned.</item>
               </list> There is not a learned and upright Man, which doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this was the Divinity of the third Age, yea, and of thoſe that follow. So that with reſpect to theſe Opinions then prevailing, they begged of God for the Dead.
<list>
                  <item>1. That he would fix them in the place of Repoſe, which they call <hi>locus refrigerii,</hi> or the Boſom of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That he would increaſe their happineſs in that place, and moderate the deſire they have to go from thence.</item>
                  <item>3. That they may go early thence, and partake in the firſt Reſurrection.</item>
                  <item>4. That they may paſs through the fire at the laſt-day without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and damage.</item>
                  <item>5. And to conclude, that they may be Abſolved when they preſent themſelves before the Throne of God: all this was not expreſſed in the Prayers of the Church.</item>
               </list> On the contrary they were conceived in general terms, it was the intention of thoſe which made Prayers for the Dead.</p>
            <p>But to what purpoſe is it to diſpute farther, whether they offered Maſſes for the repoſe of Souls in Purgatory at that time, ſince we have ancient Liturgies, where we may ſee what they begged of God for the Dead. There are two Liturgies, of which one bears the name of St. <hi>James,</hi> the other of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> We ſhall do them a great honor if we put them among the Writings of the third Age. The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy attributed to St. <hi>James,</hi> ſays, <hi>Lord God of the Spirits of all fleſh, remember the Orhtodox, of which we have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whereof we have made none, from</hi> Abel <hi>the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto this day, cauſe them to reſt in the Land of the Living, in the Boſom of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in thy Kingdom, in the delights of Paradiſe.</hi> And that of St. <hi>Mark, Cauſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49990:108"/>the Souls of our Fathers, and of our Brethren, which are dead in the Faith of Chriſt Jeſus, to reſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cauſe them to reſt in the Tabernacles of thy Saints, and give them the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> That Compoſition which is called the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Apoſtles, is a Work of the fourth, and it may be of the fifth Age. Nevertheleſs we do not ſee there in the Prayers for the Dead, any Prayer for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of Souls out of Purgatory. According to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of that time, they requeſted two things for the Dead.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Pardon all his ſins, voluntary, and involuntary, give him Angels for his guard.</hi> For the believed that in theſe ſeparate places they were aſſiſted by Angels.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Place them in the Boſom of the Patriarchs and Apoſtles, and of all thoſe that have been acceptable to thee from the beginning of the World, where there is neither ſorrow nor ſighing.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> It is the ſeparate place, where according to them Souls reſt to the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>To conclude, will you have any thing more than all this? Behold it in the Book of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy,</hi> of the falſe <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite. It is to do him great honor to quote him among the Authors of the third Age, ſince he is much more modern. But at leaſt in teaching us what was done in the following Ages, he will learn us what was not done in the Ages preceding. He ſays,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That when a Man was dead, hi Relations and Friends ſung Praiſes to God that had given him the Victory, and cauſed him to arrive at the end he deſired.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Afterwards they carried him to the Biſhop as if it were to receive the Sacred Crown.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>The Biſhop cauſed him to be carried, if he were a Laick, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Quire of the Church, and there they performed the Office of Prayers, which began with Praiſes, afterwards they read the Promiſes of the Reſurection, and ſung Pſalms:</hi> before they paſſed farther they cauſed the Catechumens to go out, <hi>after which they mentioned all the Saints heretofore dead, in whoſe Praiſes they thought the deceaſed might have ſome part. They exhorted all thoſe which were preſent, to breath after a happy end in Chriſt Jeſus, and in concluſion the Biſhop made Prayers for the Dead, he ſaluted the deceaſed perſon,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49990:108"/>and after him all the living.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> But what did theſe Prayers for the Dead contain? <hi>It is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that all the ſins which they have committed through human frailty, might be forgiven them, and that God would conduct them into the Land of the Living, into the Boſom of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>to the place where there is neither grief, ſorrow, nor ſighing.</hi> In all this there is nothing of Purgatory.</p>
            <p>To conclude, For the third and laſt difference of the Sacrifice of the Maſs at this day, where they make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dead, and the ſervices which the Chriſtians of the third and fourth Age did for them, it muſt be known, that at this time they diſtinguiſhed the Dead, whereof they make two ſorts, there are thoſe which they put in the Liturgy to Pray for them for their reſt, and deliverance from Purgatory: and others whereof they make mention to preſent their merits to God, and to be aided by their Interceſſion. For in the Maſs they make mention of the <hi>Holy Virgin, of the Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors,</hi> &amp;c. to be aided by their Prayers, and to partake in their Merits, that is to ſay, they Prayed to them, inſtead of Praying for them, but this was a thing unheard of in thoſe Ages. It was a thing ſo impoſſible that they ſhould Invoke God by the Merit of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, that they Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God even for them: juſt in the ſame manner as for the leaſt Believers. This may be ſeen in the Liturgies that we have quoted, where we have ſeen they Prayed for all Saints, from <hi>Abel</hi> to this preſent day: and the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of St. <hi>Mark</hi> makes expreſs mention of <hi>Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confeſſors,</hi> as of perſons for which it ſays, <hi>Cauſe them to reſt in the Boſom of</hi> Abraham. This by the way makes it appear, that theſe good Men make little reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon what they ſay, for they requeſt on the behalf of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, that God would ſet them in a place of reſt, nevertheleſs it is one of the Articles of their Faith that they are there already, and that they had been there from the moment of their death. But as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath well obſerved, their Prayers for the Dead were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſame terms as if they had been made at the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49990:109"/>inſtant of time when their Souls left their Bodies, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant which is the preciſe time of Praying for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins, and the reſt of their Souls. If after this the new Converts through their prejudice and blindneſs, will find the Sacrifice of the Maſs in the third Age, we know not how to help it; let them only know, that this heap of Prayers for the Dead, and Oblations for the Deceaſed, which were added to the Celebration of the Euchariſt in the third Age, was the unhappy Seed which the Spirit of Lies and Superſtition did Sow in the Church, that he might cauſe from thence to ſpring the falſe Sacrifice of the Maſs, Propitiatory both for the Living and the Dead: ſo that they ought not to be aſtoniſhed if there be ſome ſhadow of likeneſs between theſe Oblations for the Dead, and the Sacrifice of the Maſs, ſince the one is the Seed, and the other the Fruit, the one the beginning, and the other the end.</p>
            <p>This Article might ſuffice, not only for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and for Prayers for the Dead, but alſo for Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; for what we have ſaid proves that Prayer; for the Dead was by no means eſtabliſhed upon the Opinion that Souls were in fire after death, from whence they might be drawn by Maſſes. And you may, my Brethren, boldly defie your Seducers to ſhew you in that Age any paſſage in the Ancients that ſay ſo. Suffer not your ſelves to be abuſed by the Word <hi>Refrigerium,</hi> which ſignifies refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if they had deſired for Souls ſome abatement of the heat of the flames, for this Word ſignifies no other thing in the Authors of thoſe times than pleaſure, and <hi>locus refrigerii,</hi> a place of pleaſure. Beware alſo of the Knavery of your Tranſlators, who in thoſe places where they find <hi>offerre pro dormitione,</hi> that is to offer for thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, they Tranſlate it to offer for their repoſe, as if the Souls for which they Prayed had been in ſome Pain and Travel. For to offer for thoſe aſleep, is ſimply to offer for the Dead. Sleep, according to the Style o Scripture, ſignifies nothing but Death, and to offer for the Dead, or for thoſe aſleep, was to offer by making mention of the deceaſed.</p>

Behold that which was added to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in the third Age, which began to give it ſome appearance of the Maſs, but they yet wanted three great things, the Elevation, the Adoration, and the refuſal of the Cup. We do not find the leaſt trace of theſe three things, take it for granted, and put your Converters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neceſſity of proving the contrary, and you will reduce them to what is impoſſible. As for us, if we would bring you Proofs that they did Communicate under both Kinds, that they did not Elevate nor Adore, we ſhould have nothing to do but to produce a hundred places where it is clear that they gave the Communion under both Kinds, without ever ſpeaking of Elevation or Adoration. This Communicating of Infants which is not diſputed, and by conſequence we have no need to prove it, is a thing worthy of obſervation, for it is an addition of the third Age, which makes it appear,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Church is not Infallible, by the confeſſion of our Adverſaries. For the Church of the third Age, and thoſe that followed it, hath erred, according to them, in judging that the Euchariſt was neceſſary to little Children, as well as Baptiſm: therefore ſhe is not Infallible in the interpretation of the Holy Scripture, for the hath miſinterpreted thoſe Words, <hi>If any one eat not my fleſh, and drink not my blood, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have everlaſting life.</hi> Since ſhe hath believed that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren could not be Saved without Communicating.</item>
                  <item>2. That Cuſtom makes it appear that the Church is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of introducing conſiderable Innovations, and thoſe Univerſal, and of long duration. Your Converters grant that it was no Apoſtolick Tradition, that at the beginning it was not ſo, nevertheleſs it was an important Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is clear, for according to us, It is no leſs than to prophane a Sacrament, which requires ſelf examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by giving it to perſons that cannot prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt to horrible indignities, by putting it in the mouth of an Infant, of ſome few days, or months old. And that which cannot fail to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49990:110"/>is, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was oftentimes ſpit out upon the floor. For Children do not fail to reject whatſoever does not pleaſe their Palat. Moreover, this important Innovation was ſo Univerſal, that the whole Church embraced and entertained it, and of ſo long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that we find examples thereof many Ages after the fourth.</item>
                  <item>3. Learn from this Cuſtom, that in thoſe Ages they were not obliged to Adore the Sacrament before they cat it, for Children could not perform any act of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
               </list> Therefore preſs your Converters vigorouſly with this Example, and ask them if the Church cannot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate in other Articles of importance, ſince it hath plainly Innovated in this, and if we may not Correct Ancient and Univerſal Cuſtoms, ſince the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath reſcinded practices, where were introduced but one Age after the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Behold thus much for Worſhip and Practice. As to Opinion, do not ſuffer your ſelves to be perſuaded that any change in Doctrine, touching the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, did happen during the third Age. The proofs that your Converters bring thereof unto you, are very pittiful. For they are paſſages where the Fathers of that Age called the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, <hi>The Body, the Fleſh, and the Blood of the Lord.</hi> Behold verifying proofs! What is to be ſaid concerning them, ſince it is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and of his Apoſtles? The queſtion is not what they ſaid; but that we are to know, is in what ſence, and after what manner the Fathers of the third Age underſtood that the Bread of the Euchariſt was the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt. Now I do maintain that your Converters muſt be either Fools or Knaves beyond all imagination, that dare to ſay, that according to the Fathers of the third Age, that the Bread of the Euchariſt was the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by way of Reality and Tranſubſtantiation, for the Fathers of that Age ſpoke as plainly, and clearly concerning it, as we do. Hear then <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived in the beginning of that Age, among other Hereticks, with a ſort of impious Villains, who ſaid
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49990:110"/>that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had no true Body. Thus he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons againſt them, <hi>Our Lord having taken Bread, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Diſciples, made it his Body, ſaying this is my Body, that is to ſay the figure of my Body. Now this had not been a Figure if he had not had a true Body.</hi> That is to ſay, if the Figure had no relation to the true Body. <hi>For an empty thing,</hi> as is a Phantaſm, is not capable of having a Figure. Another Author of the ſame Age, whoſe Work is aſcribed to <hi>Origen,</hi> Diſputing againſt the ſame Hereticks, called <hi>Marcionites,</hi> ſays, <hi>If as theſe pretend, our Lord were deſtitute of Fleſh and Blood, of what Body, of what Fleſh, of what Blood, has he given us the Signs, and the Images,</hi> viz. <hi>The Bread and the Cup, by which he has commanded his Diſciples to preſerve and renew his memory?</hi> Theſe Men had loſt their Reaſon to ſpeak in this manner, if they believed the Real Preſence, above all in diſputing againſt thoſe which denyed that Jeſus Chriſt had a true Body. They ſay Jeſus Chriſt was no Phantaſm, he had a true Body, for he gave us in the Euchariſt the figure and Image thereof. Now Phantaſms have no Images, they themſelves being Images and no more. Theſe Men, ſay I, had loſt their wits, for they ſhould have ſaid Jeſus Chriſt was no Phantaſm, he had a true Body, for he gives this true Body to us to eat every day. Since at this day he has a Body, and we eat thereof, with great reaſon it may be affirmed he had one when he was upon Earth. The firſt Reaſon taken from the Image and Figure, is of ſome weight I do acknowledge. But this taken from the Reality in the Euchariſt, had been a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred time better, and according to the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is an argument altogether invincible. So that we muſt ſuppoſe theſe Authors did betray, and abandoned the Cauſe of the Church, by making uſe of feeble Arguments againſt the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> when ſhe had furniſhed them with one that was utterly impregnable. For, after all, it is not wholly true that Phantaſms can have no Figures or Images. It is a reflection that you ought to make, to diſcover the vanity of the Sophiſtry wherewith your Converters ſerve themſelves to anſwer to thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49990:111"/>and an hundred others, without Hyperbole, where the Fathers of the ſeven firſt Ages, called the Euchariſt, <hi>the Figure, the Type, the Image, the Symbols, the Signs, the Antitypes,</hi> of the Body and Blood of the Lord, it is, ſay they, becauſe there are two things in the Euchariſt. There is Figure and Reality. <hi>Figure, becauſe of the Accidents</hi> of Bread and Wine, which are the Figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Truth and Reality,</hi> becauſe of the Real Preſence of the Fleſh inwardly contained under the Species. Now the Fathers ſometimes reſpected the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on its external part, that is to ſay, by the Species, in this reſpect they have called it <hi>Figure.</hi> It it be ſo, at leaſt the Ancients ought not to conſider the Sacraments on the ſide of the Figure, when it was neceſſary for the Cauſe which they defended, to conſider it on the ſide of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, as it was in the diſputes againſt the <hi>Marcionites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear yet the ſame <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to the end that ye may not think that this ſlipt from him through inadvertency. Diſputing againſt the ſame Heretick <hi>Marcion,</hi> and upon the ſame Point, he ſites to him certain Words of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where according to the ancient Tranſlation it is thus, <hi>let us caſt the Wood upon his Bread,</hi> or <hi>let us caſt the Bread upon the Wood,</hi> He would prove that this Bread ſignifies the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Prophet had reſpect to his Paſſion, in which they put the Body of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Wood of his Croſs, and he adds, ſpeaking to <hi>Marcion. So hath God revealed it in our Goſpel, calling the Bread his Body, to the end that thou mayſt underſtand that at this day he hath given in the Bread the Figure of his Body, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet before had figured by Bread.</hi> The ſame Author ſays fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt did not reject the water of the Creator by which he waſhed thoſe that were his own; the Oil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he did anoint them, the Hony and the Milk which he cauſes them, as Infants, to take from the Bread, by which he repreſents his Body.</hi> Mark theſe words, <hi>by which he repreſents his Body.</hi> I know not whether a Diſciple of <hi>Calvin</hi> could ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Hear <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> an Author of the ſame Age.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49990:111"/>Expounding the words of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6. he ſaith, <hi>That by the Fleſh and Blood which Jeſus Chriſt commands us to eat, we muſt Allegorically underſtand Faith and the Promiſe.</hi> It is the fame Author that ſays, and maintains that that which Jeſus Chriſt ſaid <hi>Take drink this is my blood,</hi> ought to be underſtood by way of Allegory, and that it was true Wine: <hi>Ye know well,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that he drunk Wine foraſmuch as he was a Man, and he bleſſed Wine, ſaying, Take drink, this is my Blood, the Blood of the Vine. And the word ſignifies by Allegory the ſacred blood of joy, which was ſhed for many,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that what he bleſſed was Wine, he cauſed his Diſciples to underſtand, when he ſaid to them, I will drink no more of this fruit of the Vine, until I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.</hi> This good Doctor was openly a Diſciple of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> for he ſerves himſelf exactly with their Arguments.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, <hi>That the Lord called his Body Bread kneeded and made up of many Kernels, and his Blood Wine drawn from many Grapes.</hi> He ſays not that <hi>he made,</hi> but that <hi>he called.</hi> He ſays that <hi>by the Wine is ſhewn,</hi> or ſignified the Blood, as by the Water which is mixed with the Wine, is ſignified the People.</p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Origen</hi> in the ſame Age, Writing on thoſe words <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>That which enters into the mouth defileth not the Man.</hi> He makes a difficulty on this, that it ſeems the Euchariſt that enters into the Mouth doth not ſanctifie the Man, if ſo it be that what enters into the Mouth do neither ſanctifie nor defile him. To this he anſwers that the Bread <hi>which is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer, doth not of its own nature ſanctifie him which makes uſe thereof, for if it were ſo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it would ſanctifie him which eateth thereof unworthily. He adds that there is advantage in eating the Bread of the Lord, when we participate thereof with a clear Mind, and a pure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> &amp;c. And at laſt concludes with theſe words, <hi>If all that which enters into the Mouth goes into the Belly, and be caſt out into the draught, this Bread which is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer, according to what it hath that is material, goes into the Belly, and from thence to the place of Excrements; but in relation to the Prayers that have been made thereon it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49990:112"/>in proportion to a Mans faith, which does illuminate the mind, and make it attentive to thoſe things which are profitable. And it is not the matter of Bread, but the Word which is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over it, which profits him that does not eat unworthy of the Lord. Behold thus much concerning the Typical and Symbolical Body. Many things alſo may be ſaid concerning the Word it ſelf, which was made fleſh, and which is become true food, whereof whoſoever ſhall eat ſhall live for ever. No wicked man can eat thereof. For if it were poſſible, that he that perſeveres in evil could eat the Word which was made fleſh, that is, as it is the Word and the living Bread, it would not have been waſted. He which ſhall eat of this Bread ſhall live for over.</hi> I know not whether <hi>Calvin</hi> could have written more clearly:
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Bread, as to the matter thereof, remains.</item>
                  <item>2. That this matter ſuffers all that which other Aliments do ſuffer, even to its deſcent into the draught.</item>
                  <item>3. That it's Faith which makes us partakers of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, and that we eat in proportion to the Faith and Attention that we bring thither.</item>
                  <item>4. That it is a ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Body of the Symbol of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>5. That no wicked Man or Unbeliever can eat Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he is not eaten but by Faith.</item>

            <p>I do profeſs unto you, that I know not how theſe Mens Minds and Souls are made, to maintain after theſe paſſages, that they believed the Doctrine of the Real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation in the third Age.

Give atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Brethren, I do adjure you, and call to mind alſo that notable matter of Fact practiſed in the third Age, which we have proved unto you in the preceding Letter.

                  <item>2. That this ought to be the Rule of all the following Ages.</item>
               </list> For, when afterwards they produce unto me an hundred hard improper expreſſions on the ſubject of the Sacrament, I am aſſured that they ought to be interpreted according to the Faith of the third Age; for what reaſon? Becauſe none of the Ancients hath accuſed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> nor <hi>Origen</hi> of Heterodoxy, although they condemned without ſcruple many of their Opinions. I have been longer upon the Euchariſt of the third Age, becauſe it is important to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand well the Faith thereof, for it being the laſt Age of the Purity of the Church, it ought to ſerve as a Rule to Judge of thoſe that follow.</p>
            <p>I will finiſh this Letter by continuing the Hiſtory of our Martyrs, whereof we have made 3 Orders. I come to the third kind, ſuch to whom they have preſented death as preſent and certain, and who have courageouſly offered themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. For 'tis a divertiſement that the Perſecutors often give themſelves, and a kind of temptation which they have often exerciſed to declare to our Confeſſors, that the Sentence of Death is pronounced againſt them, and that they muſt die if they did not change their Religion immediately. And we have not heard that any one has faln under this kind of tryal. M. <hi>de Voutron,</hi> a Gentleman in the Neighborhood of <hi>Rochel,</hi> hath given us within a few days a great example of this kind of Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>He indured for the ſpace of a year the moſt cruel Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could be imagined; he ſuffered hunger and thirſt, he lay upon the ground with Irons on his feet in a Dungeon dark and deep without light, without fire in the winter, and without other nouriſhment than a little Bread and Water, whereof oftentimes they did not give him the half of what was neceſſary for his nouriſhment. At laſt in the end of the year, the Governor of <hi>S. Martin de Re,</hi> where he was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, came to ſee him, and told him, that it was with extreme grief that he was conſtrained to tell him very unhappy news: 'Twas that the King had appointed, that all thoſe that were Rebels on the Subject of Religion, ſhould be put to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49990:113"/>death; the Gentlemen were to be beheaded, and the others hanged, that he would very willingly have been excuſed from this Commiſſion, but could not avoid it; that nevertheleſs he felt ſome joy in this, that at this time he might be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof God might ſerve himſelf to reſcue him from Hereſie, and the Precipice from which he was about to fall, that he had but one ſtep to make to deliver himſelf from it, to gain Paradiſe, to eſtabliſh his Fortune, and that of all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Our Confeſſor believed the thing in good earneſt, and it is not difficult to believe, that they would proſecute their cruelty to the uttermoſt, when they had continued it to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment ſo long, and ſo barbarous. But he was not moved thereby the leaſt in the world, unleſs by emotions of Joy. He anſwered; <hi>Monſieur, this news is ſo far from afflicting me, that it rejoyces and comforts me, ſince it will end all the troubles of my Impriſonment, and I ſhall enjoy the ſight of my God. I have made my choice, and when it ſhall pleaſe you to cauſe me to mount the Scaffold, I am ready. The favour that I beg of you is, that if you cauſe any one to die before me, you will permit me to accompany him to his Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead of executing the Threatning, within two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they drew him out of the Dungeon, and gave him the Caſtle at large for his priſon, with liberty to ſee his Kindred and Friends. We ſhall ſee how long this will laſt.</p>
            <p>It is written alſo from <hi>Picardy,</hi> that two Damoſels of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Rank, of <hi>Laon,</hi> Seamſtreſſes by their Profeſſion, ſaw the little that they had, waſted, without being moved or ſhaken; after which they impriſoned them in places where they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the whole Winter without fire, or covering, but one ſingle Coat. During the ſpace of eight months, they made uſe of all that which the craft and rage of Perſecutors in theſe laſt days could invent to vanquiſh and overcome them. They reſiſted all. In concluſion they pronounced their Sentence, which condemned them to death; they carried on the Play to the laſt, for they led them to the place of Execution, and cauſed them to ſee a Pile of Wood inkindled to burn them. Nothing ſtruck them, they perſevered; they undreſſed, and prepared themſelves to be bound to the Poſt. The chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49990:113"/>laughed at what aſtoniſhed all the world, and ſaid, <hi>Theſe are fools enough to ſuffer themſelves to be burnt.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed them, and drove them out of the City; they forbad all the world to entertain or feed them. For my part, I do not ſee why this may not be called Martyrdom, ſeeing God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the intentions and diſpoſitions of the Soul much more than external actions, we can't doubt that he doth not reckon thoſe for Martyrs, which have offered him their life, and put it into his hands with ſo much reſignation, altho death did not follow as they expected and believed.</p>
            <p>If we will have Martyrs according to the moſt perfect Rules and Laws, the Conſtancy of our Brethren in <hi>Cevennes</hi> will not fail to furniſh us with a very great number, if we may believe ſome Letters that come from <hi>Niſmes.</hi> The Governor and Intendant have within a few days cauſed 75 Men and one Woman to be hanged at S. <hi>Hyppolite.</hi> This Butchery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſo terrible, that I am reſolved not to give a full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to it till further confirmation. We may ſee in one of our precedent Letters the perſeverance of theſe honeſt Men to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for Prayers to God, notwithſtanding the Puniſhments and Dragoons. The ſevere Declaration of <hi>July</hi> 12. which condemns to death all thoſe which exerciſe the Reformed Religion, has not at all abated this heat and zeal. For know, that they aſſemble every day, and that they cauſe them every day to ſuffer Martyrdom. The publick News Printed at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> are ſufficiently true and exact on this point, becauſe they are publiſhed from Memorials that come from perſons that are upon the place. Theſe Memorials have told us that 40 perſons were killed upon the place at an Aſſembly, that they have ſeiſed on a very great number of other perſons, and that they have diſcovered and ſurpriſed theſe Aſſemblies. That a young Gentleman of the Houſe of M. <hi>Julian,</hi> named M. <hi>de Frumey-rolle</hi> had his Head cut off, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived death with a piety and conſtancy in nothing inferior to that of the greateſt Martyrs. His Brother, the eldeſt of the Houſe, was ſent to the Priſon of <hi>Ayques Mortes.</hi> They have hanged of Men and Women a number that can't be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the reports concerning it are ſomething various.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49990:114"/>But 'tis certain that Executions are done every day, and that they die with all the Characters of the Martyrs of God, and of his Truth. A favour for which we are to give eternal Praiſes to our dear Saviour.</p>
            <p>The Martyrs of the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont</hi> alone would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a large Chapter. But we muſt delay it till we can receive exact Memorials concerning them. That which we know of them is, that ſome of the Miniſters made Priſoners by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> were hanged. Among others M. <hi>Leydet,</hi> whoſe conſtancy did aſtoniſh, and make the whole Court of the Duke to tremble: the poor Priſoners ſuffered unheard of Cruelties in their Impriſonment. The Duke's People have publiſhed abroad that they were very well treated, and that they gave to them the ſame quantity of Proviſions which they gave to their Soldiers, that they oftentimes gave them freſh Straw, that they ſuffered the ſick to take the air, and alſo that they gave them Wine. But the truth is, they did all that could be done to deſtroy them, that they might deliver themſelves from the fear of ſeeing them in Arms, and returning to their own Eſtates and Poſſeſſions. They put Mortar in their Bread, they gave them nothing to drink but ſtinking water, and they let them die in their dung and ordure. And they have been ſo ſucceſsful in their deſign, that there is a place where, of 400 perſons, there are 250 dead; nevertheleſs we have not heard that any one did renounce his Religion, it were injuſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe both the Name and Glory of Martyrdom to thoſe which have died in ſo conſtant and ſo difficult a Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Church hath put its Confeſſors one degree below Martyrs, but in truth I do not find that they are much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to them. I do openly avow that there are Confeſſors which I admire more than Martyrs. It is in my opinion a more glorious Work to endure a terrible and furious Combat, during the ſpace of many months or years, than to behold the face of death for a few moments. And we may ſay with aſſurance, that ſuch perſons have faln in a long Confeſſion, which would courageouſly have endured the ſight of death. Therefore, my Brethren, do honor to ſo many Believers which have ſuffered to afford you an example. Remember how
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49990:114"/>many righteous perſons are in the Gallies, laden in Chains, but incircled with Glory. We have there two which are very famous among many others, who, it may be, are not inferior to them, tho they be leſs known to us. We have there M. <hi>de Marolles,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken already, and ſome of whoſe Letters we have communicated unto you. We have there another Man of Learning and Merit, called M. <hi>Le Feure,</hi> of a conſiderable Family of <hi>Chaſtel Chinon</hi> in <hi>Nivernois,</hi> of the Church of <hi>Corbigni.</hi> This faithful Chriſtian, after he had avoided with a great deal of labor, the occaſions and ſeaſons of Subſcriptions, by ſhifting hither and thither, at length he puts himſelf on the way to go out of the Kingdom. He was ſeiſed upon the Frontiers, towards the beginning of the month of <hi>March,</hi> he was conducted to <hi>Beſancon,</hi> where he was put into a Dungeon, in which, during the ſpace of three months, he experienced all the Severities which they put upon the greateſt Criminals, and he endured all the Temptations of Threatnings, Promiſes and Diſputes, which the Perſecutors are wont to make uſe of, to vanquiſh the Conſtancy of the Saints. By word of mouth and writing he cauſed all his Friends to know, that they had no reaſon to fear on his behalf, and all his Letters bore the Marks and Characters of true Chriſtianity, by the Humility, Sweetneſs, Piety and Patience which were manifeſted and diſplayed there. After he had languiſhed many months in Dungeons, with a Body naturally weak and ſickly, he was condemned for ever to the Gallies. They ſent him in Chains to <hi>Dijon,</hi> where he met with M. <hi>de Marolles,</hi> which they brought from <hi>Paris.</hi> So theſe two illuſtrious Confeſſors, who already knew each other by the report of their Courage and Sufferings, were joyned together to be a pair of eminent Witneſſes to the Truth. They had the ſame Fortune as they had the ſame Heart, both were ſick even unto death upon the way, whilſt they dragged their Chains after them; both arrived at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> and both are actually in the Gallies, bearing their Chains both night and day, by expreſs order from the Court, and both of them with the ſame courage purſue the glorious Race of their Martyrdom, until it ſhall pleaſe God to grant them the Crown after which they breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:49990:115"/>
Amongſt the Confeſſions which are well worthy of Martyrs, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to place that of a Gentlewoman of <hi>Poictou</hi> near St. <hi>Maix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> about the Age of fifty or fifty five years, whoſe name is ſlipt from us, though there be many Witneſſes of the ſame place, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and aſſured us with one conſent of the truth of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hiſtory. She endured the firſt rage of the Dragoons, that is to ſay, the waſting of her Eſtate, their Threatnings, Blaſphemies, and other Evangelical means of our modern Converters. Her Goods being waſted, the Soldiers attacked her Perſon, and there was not any kind of Torment, Violence, Blows, or Reproaches, which they did not offer to her. They tied her to the poſt of a Bed, where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a long time the object of the impudence and fury of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who proceeded to commit all the outrages upon her, that an honeſt Woman could ſuffer, except Violation. In concluſion, one of theſe Wretches thought fit to tell her, if you can ſuffer a living Coal upon your hand during the ſpace of a <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> we will let you go. She conſented very freely. They then took the greateſt, and the moſt burning Coal that was in the Fire; ſhe had the Courage to ſtretch out her Hand, and to hold it herſelf ſtretched out, without complaint, and to pronounce <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. from the beginning to the end, a Dragoon in the mean time blowing the Coal for fear it ſhould go out, which ſcorched her Fleſh and Skin, and made her Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to bubble and boil: when this as done, one of the Soldiers raging, and ſwearing ſaid, thou haft ſaid the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> too quickly. I will ſay it my ſelf, and if thou canſt endure a light Coal of Fire on the other Hand, whilſt I repeat my <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> we will give thee thy Liberty. This poor Woman conſented to this ſecond propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the ſame chearfulneſs which ſhe had manifeſted at the firſt, this was done. The Soldier takes the Coal, ſhe receives it, and held up her Hand in the Air, with the fire Coal, which conſumed it, whilſt the Soldier ſaid his <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> putting a great diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween word and word. In concluſion, another Soldier overcome by an example of Courage ſo extraordinary, blamed him for repeating his Prayer ſo ſlowly, and ſtruck off the Coal from her hand, and ſo they left her. Behold ſay I, in my Opinion, a Confeſſion well worthy of a true Martyr. Praiſed be God, that we have yet ſouls ſo inſpired of God to overcome ſuch puniſhments, and ſo inflamed with his Love, that they can ſurmount the burning Fire.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have already begun in the laſt Letters, to give you a Hiſtory of the Faith of the Church in the Third Age; and the laſt thing upon which we ſtaid was the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantiation. We have nothing more to ſay about the Article of Purgatory than what we have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it on the Subject of Oblations, and Sacrifice for the Dead; we will only add, that <hi>Origen,</hi> a Man of great ſenſe in that Age, and alſo of great boldneſs, who among
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49990:116"/>many bold and raſh Opinions advanced that of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Hell, that is to ſay properly, of Purgatory, of a Fire in which the Wicked ought to be purified, that they may be ſaved after ſome Ages of Torment. And 'tis of this temporary Hell, jumbled with the ſeparate ſtate of Souls, that the Purgatory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is at laſt formed and made.</p>
            <p>We therefore paſs to Worſhip, Adoration, and Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Creatures, of Saints, of the Bleſſed Virgin, of Angels, of Relicks, and of Images: This is a place of Triumph for the Truth, and Confuſion for Error. Ask, my Brethren, ask, and be you never weary thereof; bid them ſhew you <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, Minutius Foelix, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Arnobius, Lactantius,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> of whom we have ſo many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; let them ſhew you them (I ſay) recommending the Worſhip of the Virgin, the Invocation of Saints, and the Adoration of Relicks. Their Silence ſuffices to make it known, that then men knew not what this unhappy Superſtition was: and if their Silence be not enough, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which we have proved unto you; 'tis firſt, that then they prayed for all Saints in general, both Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs: now it is inconſiſtent to pray to a Saint and for him, as your Converters will acknowledge; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pray to a Saint ſuppoſes him glorified, and to pray for a Saint or Martyr ſuppoſes him not glorified. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Remember alſo, that in thoſe Ages the prevailing Opinion was, That the Martyrs themſelves and Apoſtles, were not yet in Heaven, and by conſequence, did not ſee the face of God; ſo that they could neither learn from God the neceſſities of the Living, nor intercede for them before him.</p>
            <p>After this know, That in this Age, as well as that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, Chriſtians made open Proteſtations, That they did not ſerve, adore, nor invoke, any other but God. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Scorpiac.</hi> cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>That 'tis appointed, that I call upon no other God, that I may no more make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49990:116"/>God by my tongue, than by my hand. 'Tis ordained that I adore or worſhip no other, after what manner ſoever it be, beſides the One God, which commands this in his Law.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul. cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>We ſerve but one only God, which you naturally know, whoſe Thunder and Lightnings you fear, and from whom you receive Bleſſings with great joy.</hi> He ſerves himſelf of the Words Venerate, and Serve, and they are general words: Where is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt that will ſay, That he gives no Worſhip but to God alone? <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Strom. <hi>lib.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>The</hi> Greeks <hi>ought to learn from the Law and the Prophets to ſerve but one only God, who is truly Almighty. Origen</hi> repeats the ſame thing in a hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, That Chriſtians worſhip and ſerve God alone.</p>
            <p>But if this be not enough, hear <hi>Origen</hi> after he had ſaid in expreſs words,<note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5.</hi> cont. Celſ.</note> That we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs all Prayer, Supplication, Requeſt, and Thankſgiving, to the Supream God, Lord of all things by the Eternal Word, God the High Prieſt, who is above all Angels; after that ſay I, he excludes by name Angels from the number of thoſe which ought to be invoked. <hi>To the end,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Angels may be propitious to us, and that they may do all things for us, it ſuffices in the firſt place that we be very cloſely united to God, and diſpoſed to imitate Angels who imitate God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That 'tis beſt to truſt in God, and to beg of him all the aid, and all the ſuccour which can come to us from good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For 'tis,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a thing altogether unreaſonable, that we ſhould invoke Angels, ſeeing we know nothing of their ſervice, or knowledge, becauſe it is above men. Although we ſhould grant that their knowledge, which is admirable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, may be underſtood, this ſame knowledge which we have of their Nature, and of the thing over which every one of them preſides, would hinder us from daring to invoke any other but the Lord who is over all things, and ſufficient for all.</hi> 'Tis certain, that <hi>Origen</hi> had loſt his Underſtanding, if at that time they invoked Angels; and if they did not invoke
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49990:117"/>Angels, how could they invoke the Saints departed? Do we not learn from Scripture, that Angels are round about us, and by conſequence, that they hear us? Do we not know that God hath committed to them the care and preſervation of his Children? we know nothing of all this concerning Saints: ſo thoſe which did not invoke Angels certainly never did invoke Saints. As for Relicks, my Brethren, ask your Converters, ask their Proofs, that men took them from their Tombs, that they put them in Boxes, that every one carried his part thereof in great Devotion, that they wrought Miracles, that Men went in Pilgrimage to the Tombs of Martyrs, where Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were laid, that they kiſſed them, and fell on their knees before them. If they cannot prove this, let them confeſs that this Worſhip was perfectly unknown in the third Age. Mr. <hi>Demabis,</hi> a revolted Miniſter, confeſſes clearly enough, that in the firſt Ages they gave not this external Honor to Relicks; becauſe, ſays he, the ſtate in which they were did not permit it. Is not this a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable defence? They ſay, 'twas a time of Perſecution; I confeſs it; but it was the more eaſie for them to get the Aſhes and Bones of Martyrs, for they made them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day: 'tis true, that in ſome places the Pagans hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Chriſtians from taking their Bodies, but in many others they left them on the Dunghil to him that would firſt take them; and all their rigour could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from getting ſome one of their Bones from the flames, as did the Believers of <hi>Smyrna</hi> thoſe of <hi>Polycarpus.</hi> The Perſecution did not hinder Chriſtians from kiſſing theſe Bones on their knees, in their private Houſes and Oratories.</p>
            <p>As to what concerns Images, I cannot reſolve to make an Article thereof, although I had intended it; for I do not think that there is any learned man among your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters, who hath the impudence to maintain that there were Images in Churches during the time of the third Age, and that men worſhip'd them, after we have proved
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49990:117"/>unto them, that in that Age Painters and Statuaries were accounted infamous, and that they drove them from the Communion of the Church, as they did Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians, Bauds, and other inſtruments of Wickedneſs and beaſtly Pleaſures, and that there the Chriſtians ſcoffed at the Pagans, which proſtrated themſelves before Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Wood, Copper, Stone, Gold and Silver, which might be ſtoln, and carried away; in the mouths and ears whereof Mice made their Habitations, and upon which Birds laid their Ordure. They offered, I ſay, a thouſand Reproaches to the Pagans about their Statues, all which might be retorted againſt the Chriſtians, if they had had any themſelves; and to expoſe themſelves to theſe Replies, it muſt be ſaid, that they had loſt both Memory and Senſe. I would very willingly know what <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> would have ſaid, had he ſeen Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches, who ſaid concerning Women that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held themſelves in Glaſſes,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pedag.</hi> lib. 3. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> Moſes <hi>did for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bid Men to make any Image which repreſented God, how can theſe Women be innocent, who by a fictitious Repreſentation, make Images of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</hi> Read therefore, <hi>Tertullian, Arnobius, Minutius Foelix, Lactantius, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> And if ye be not qualified, my Brethren, for the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, ask your Converters, if what we have ſaid above be not true: they will not have the impudence to deny it; 'tis a matter of Fact, which is confeſſed by the more honeſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion; amongſt others, by <hi>Baluzius,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Lactantius, concerning the Death of Perſecutors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Third Age they began to give Rules concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days of Faſting. The <hi>African</hi> Church, beſides the Lords Day, had two other days in the week conſecrated to Prayer, that is to ſay, <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Friday,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſet apart <hi>Saturday</hi> to that end and uſe. According to the Diſcipline of the Ancient Church, it was not permitted to faſt on the Lords Day,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49990:118"/>and for that reaſon, ſhe ſet apart two other days in the Week to join Prayer with Faſting, and called thoſe days <hi>Stations.</hi> They were reckoned for half Faſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they faſted no longer than till three hours after Noon; whereas in compleat Faſts, they abſtained from eating till the Sun were ſet. At this day, inſtead of half Faſts (as they call them) they ought to call them Faſts leſs than half, for they faſt not but from ſix in the Morning until Noon, in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> a great Mortification to make ſo great account on! Theſe half Faſts were accompanied with publick Prayers: For the Chriſtians aſſembled together, continued in Prayer at the Church until three hours after Noon; and as it was the cuſtom of that time to communicate in all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, they concluded theſe Stations or half Faſts with the celebration of the Euchariſt. They did not communicate in the Morning, in the beginning of their Aſſembly, becauſe thoſe days were accounted days of Faſt, and they then believed that the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, did break their Faſt; for as yet they were not inſtructed in the method of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the Subſtance, and leaving nothing but Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Lent, and the other Faſts of this day were then wholly unknown. They faſted in this Age (as they did in the ſecond) the Paſſion-day and that which followed it, but no more. And becauſe the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taniſts, a ſort of Hereticks, amongſt which <hi>Tertullian</hi> liſted himſelf towards the end of his life, would conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate two Weeks in the Year to faſt in; The Catholick Church made a great ſtir about it; and that which is remarkable is, that then the Church ſerved it ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of the ſame reaſon againſt the Montaniſts, which we make uſe of againſt the Faſts of the Papiſts,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertul.</hi> Lib. de Jejun. c. 15.</note> particularly they made uſe of thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That falſe teachers ſhould come, who ſhould command to abſtain
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49990:118"/>from meats, which God had permitted to believers; that we muſt not obſerve days, and months, and years; that we muſt eat of every thing, and at all times, without asking queſtions for conſcience ſake.</hi> We muſt ſuppoſe an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of mind, without excuſe, to believe that men who diſputed thus againſt the Montaniſts about two Weeks Faſting, ſhould themſelves have and obſerve five or ſix. Nevertheleſs you muſt hold this for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that theſe two Weeks of Faſting of the Montaniſts were the beginning of Lent; for a little while after, the Church was aſhamed to ſee it ſelf ſurpaſſed with Mortifications, by perſons they accounted Hereticks, and therefore ſhe was willing to out-bid and out do them.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, they make you extracts from S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> a great Man, and a very holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, in which you oftentimes read the words <hi>Satisfactions and Indulgencies.</hi> But let this example teach you, not to ſuffer your ſelves to be ſeduced by a ſimilitude of terms and words; for thoſe Satisfactions and Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies have no alliance or cognation with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then the Diſcipline of the Church was extremely ſevere upon mens Faults and Crimes, againſt which, the Romiſh Confeſſors at this day, do oftentimes appoint but very gentle Penances, and no forbearance from the Sacrament: But they commanded Sinners the forbearance of many years together, with many long and tedious Faſts and Mortifications. Thoſe who had accompliſhed their years of Penance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, were ſaid to make, and have made <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But, Firſt, They did not then imagin that theſe Satisfactions were intended to excuſe them from the pains of Purgatory, as hath ſince been believed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Theſe Satisfactions were properly made to the Church, and its Diſcipline, and not to the Juſtice of God. 'Tis true, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks ſometimes of <hi>Satisfying God;</hi> but theſe words with him, ſignifie no more than to appeaſe God with Prayers and Humiliations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49990:119"/>
Thoſe Chriſtians which fell through the violence of Perſecution, did owe to the Church very rough and ſevere Penances, according to the Rules of her Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. All were not capable of bearing the trouble of long Penances, therefore they deſired that they would remit the whole, or ſome part of it, and receive them to the Peace of the Church. To obtain which, they made their applications to their Martyrs and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors which were in Priſon for the Cauſe of Jeſus.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cypr.</hi> Epiſt. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</note> Theſe Confeſſors wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of interceſſion, addreſſed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Presbyters, and People, to the end that they might receive theſe Sinners to the Peace and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without cauſing them to paſs through the rigor of their Diſcipline. They had ſo great a reſpect to the Confeſſors of the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, that they could deny them nothing. So that at their Interceſſions they admitted Sinners without Penance, and this was called <hi>Indulgence,</hi> this is it whereof S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> complains in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Epiſtles. I intreat you, my Brethren, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this place how the Devil takes occaſion from things the moſt innocent, to eſtabliſh Opinions and Practices greatly faulty and criminal. For behold the firſt original of application to the Interceſſion of Saints, Indulgences, and Merits of Supererogation.</p>
            <p>From Saints who were in Priſon for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they aſcended to the Saints who are in Heaven. At firſt they prayed the Holy Martyrs that were on earth to intercede for them with the Church. Afterwards they came to pray the ſame Martyrs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to intercede with God for them. They called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences the relaxation of the Severity of Diſcipline, which the Church granted at the requeſt of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. At this day they call Indulgence the relaxation of the Juſtice of God, which he grants as they ſuppoſe, in conſiderations of the Merits and Sufferings of the Martyrs, who ſuffered more than was neceſſary for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49990:119"/>To conclude, they have changed the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reſpect which they had for the Interceſſions of Confeſſors and Martyrs, into Merits and Works of Supererogation. The Church did retard the rigor of her Law againſt Sinners, becauſe of the eſteem which ſhe had for thoſe that ſuffered for the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. At this day they grant Indulgences by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Merit of thoſe which have ſuffered too much, either by involuntary Perſecutions, or by choſen and voluntary Mortifications. But hear how the ſame S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks very aptly concerning one of theſe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors named <hi>Lucian,</hi> who carried himſelf too haughtily, and deſired too earneſtly that they ſhould have reſpect to his Letters of Interceſſion.<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. 34.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid that we muſt Baptize Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and that all Sins paſt are forgiven in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. But this man, that is to ſay, the Confeſſor</hi> Lucian, <hi>knowing neither the Law nor the Commandments, commands that we give Peace, and pardon Sins in the Name of S.</hi> Paul, <hi>not conſidering that they are not the Martyrs who make the Goſpel, but that it is the Goſpel which makes the Martyrs.</hi> Therefore at that time they did not alledge the Threats of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Martyrs and Confeſſors, as the reaſons for which they granted Indulgences, that is to ſay, the relaxation of the Diſcipline of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Age, that is to ſay the third, they will produce unto you the word <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and the terms of <hi>being on their knees at the feet of their Prieſts.</hi> And they will not fail to find for you there the Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion practiſed at this day; but there is nothing more falſe. For thoſe which dazle your Eyes thereby, do very well know, that the Greek word which ſignifies Confeſſion, was not at that time any ſecret Confeſſion. But the whole Act, or Actions of publick Penance were ſo called: And if at that Age Penitents were ſeen at the feet of Papiſts, this was not done in ſecret, and in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49990:120"/>a place appointed for the receiving Confeſſions, where they acknowledged all their Sins in the Ear of the Prieſt. But in Churches and in publick, that they might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Prayer and impoſition of hands, either to Penance or to the Peace of the Church. It was ſo certainly a publick Action, that the Pagans took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from thence to accuſe the Chriſtians of adoring the ſhameful parts of their Prieſts. This Confeſſion was made in publick, with Sack-cloth, Aſhes, and Tears, begging the Prayers and Aſſiſtance of all Chriſtians. This may be ſeen fully explicated in the Ninth and Tenth Chapters of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Book of Repentance.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, My Brethren, it is neceſſary that you make to your ſelves a juſt and ligitimate Idea of the Unity of the Church. They tell you that there is but one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and that there cannot be many. This is true, there is but one Church univerſal, and even the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49990:122"/>Word Univerſal, that is added thereunto makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that there can be but one. Juſt after the ſame manner that the word Univerſe (by which is ſignified the World) ſignifies alſo that there is but one, for if there were another World beſides this, ours would not be the Univerſe, ſeeing it would not comprehend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally all. But the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> and thoſe that are like unto him, give you a pleaſant Idea of its Unity and Univerſality both together. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay they, is this univerſal and only Church, it is univerſal, and yet nevertheleſs, out of it, and ſeparate from it there are many other Churches. This is juſt as if I ſhould ſay, our World is the Univerſe, nevertheleſs there be many other Worlds beſides it. Is not this abſurd? But it will be ſaid, that theſe Propoſitions are not alike nor the ſame, for we mean thereby all other Churches; beſides, the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches are falſe Churches. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſurdity altogether alike, as if a perſon or a man ſhould ſay; 'Tis true, there are many Worlds beſides ours; nevertheleſs, ours is the Univerſe, becauſe all the reſt are falſe Worlds. If they Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſay, Indeed I am but part of the Church Univerſal; but I am the only ſound and entire part, the others are ſick and diſeaſed. where a man cannot be ſaved: If it ſhould ſpeak thus, ſay I, it would ſpeak falſe, but it would ſpeak nothing abſurd or contradictory, and there would be reaſon to examin its pretenſions to the bottom, to know if indeed it be the only Church that is ſound and without Errors. But it muſt have renounced common ſenſe, to avow that out of her Boſom there are many Churches, and nevertheleſs call her ſelf the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
               <p>However it be, her pretenſion is, that the Unity of the Church conſiſts in a certain Communion, character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized and diſtinguiſhed from all others by certain limits and boundaries, and under certain Paſtors, out of which Communion, whether you believe in Jeſus Chriſt or not,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49990:122"/>whether you have conſiderable Errors or no, you are always out of the Church and hopes of Salvation, altho you ſhould believe and maintain all the truths of the Goſpel from the beginning to the end, tho you ſhould be Orthodox as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> retaining all the Articles of the Chriſtan Faith, yea, of the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if nevertheleſs you live in ſeparation with this certain Seat and this certain Church, which is the Church Catholick you muſt be certainly damned. I intreat you, my Brethren, before you go further, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Queſtion to your Converts. Tell them I am content to grant there is a certain particular Church, in which is that Unity from which we muſt never ſeparate. But how ſhall I know that this Church, in which is that Unity to which we ought to adhere, is the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> for I have heard ſay, that there are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches; among others, it hath been told me, there is a Church in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> called the Greek Church, which hath ſix Patriarchs, that is to ſay, for Popes, the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and theſe do all in like manner Anathematize the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Propoſe to them, ſay I, this difficulty, and preſs it home, and you will ſee them brought into ſuch ſtreights, that they can ſay nothing but impertinences and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities: They will tell you that <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſeat of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> it is to her that this Priviledg was granted, all thoſe which ſeparate from her, depart from Unity. So that the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and the three Popes whereof we have ſpoken, are out of the Unity. Can there be a greater Abſurdity than to anſwer by that which has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſpute? It is not true that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Chair of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhall it may be have occaſion to prove it to you in ſome other place. But although it ſhould be true, where is it ſaid that the Priviledg of Unity ought to be affixed to the Chair of S. <hi>Peter?</hi> The Pope of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> ſays, I am in the Chair of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> who was an Apoſtle. The Pope of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſays, 'Tis I who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49990:123"/>am in the true Chair of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> for according to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſeven years Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> before he was Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo that it is the firſt Chair, ſounded by the chief of the Apoſtles. The Pope of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria</hi> ſaith, I am in the Chair of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who was an Evangeliſt, and had the Spirit of Infallibility as well as St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Behold three Popes againſt one, three Churches againſt one, three Apoſtles or Evangeliſts againſt one; wherefore then, Gentlemen Converters, would you that I ſhould eſteem you as only in the rightful poſſeſſion of Unity, to the prejudice of Perſons which pretend to have as good a Title to it as your ſelves? Preſs theſe falſe <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Teachers on this point, and you will ſee ſuch confuſion, and ſuch a multitude of Words in their Diſcourſe, which will diſcover to you the falſeneſs of their pretenſions.</p>
               <p>After this we will conſider the Propoſition in it ſelf, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion that is neceſſary to Salvation is included in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>alone; out of it there is neither Salvation, Faith, Grace, Remiſſion of Sins, nor the True Church: ſo that every man which is ſeparate from it by Schiſm alone, without Hereſie, dies eternally.</hi> I do maintain, That this Propoſition is the moſt fooliſh, but withal, the moſt cruel and barbarous that ever was aſſerted: and I do beſeech you, my Brethren, to be attentive to the proofs that I ſhall make thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, According to the Scripture, Fathers, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon, the Unity of the Church ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Univerſality in it ſelf; that is to ſay, That Church which is One ought to be univerſal, and extended through all the World; it ought to comprehend all Chriſtians. I will not prove this, for it's clear and alſo confeſſed: 'tis a truth ſo known among the Ancients, that they look on certain Schiſmaticks of the fourth and fifth Age, called <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> as Fools. Theſe People, in the beginning of the fourth Age, ſeparated themſelves from the reſt of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and all <hi>Africa:</hi> this Separation was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49990:123"/>cauſed by the Election of a Biſhop of <hi>Carthage.</hi> This hath always been one of the moſt fruitful Sources of Diviſion. Theſe <hi>Donatiſts</hi> ſaid preciſely that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſays at this day,<note n="*" place="margin">Aug. de Agone Chriſti, <hi>Cap. 28.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>All the Church is fall'n into Apoſtaſie, and is only preſerved in the Communion of</hi> Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: upon which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus cries out, <hi>Oh proud and wicked Tongue!</hi> Certain other Schiſmaticks called <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians,</hi> fell into the ſame dotage, That the Church was periſhed, and continued not but in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and ſome Mountains near <hi>Rome,</hi> where they had Followers and Diſciples. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> treats them on that Subject, as men that had loſt their Underſtanding.<note n="†" place="margin">Jerome Dialog. adv. Lucifer.</note> 
                  <hi>If it be ſo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died only for the Peaſants of</hi> Sardinia: <hi>Where then is the accompliſhment of that word of the Father, Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance?</hi> Behold exactly the folly of the Papiſts, the Church is periſh'd throughout the World, except at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> but we, with the Scriptures and the Fathers, ſay, <hi>Let the North give up, and let not the South keep back.</hi> All the parts of the World ſhall bring forth Children to God; and the Church ought to be extended to all places where the Goſpel is. Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor in <hi>Muſcovy, Aſia, Egypt, Africa,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where nevertheleſs there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Chriſtians: it is not in <hi>England, Holland, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> nor in a great part of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> reacheth not to all the Countries and Kingdoms; for 'tis ridiculous to ſay that 'tis diſperſed throughout the World, becauſe there are ſome Jeſuits at <hi>London,</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries, Sweden, Conſtantinople,</hi> and in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and ſome <hi>Latines</hi> hid here and there, where they have ſmall Congregations, but little known, and as it were under ground. I might as well ſay that Calviniſm is extended through all <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe there are ſome of the Reformed ſcatter'd here and there in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49990:124"/>
Secondly, According to the Hypotheſis of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> every one that errs, though never ſo little, that is to ſay, who goes off from that which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, is out of the Unity of the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of Salvation. Behold how ill this agrees with that notable Paſſage whereof thoſe of ours that are weak and fearful make great uſe; 'tis that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 11. where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>For other Foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt. Now if any man build upon this Foundation, Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble; every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the fire ſhall try every mans work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if any mans work be burnt he ſhall ſuffer loſs, but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Without taking notice of what may be difficult in this Paſſage, 'tis clear, That thoſe which build are Teachers, that the Gold, Silver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones are ſound Doctrines, that the Wood, Hay, and Stubble are ſuch as are unſound and falſe; 'tis alſo clear, that they which teach theſe falſe Doctrines may be ſaved, and with greater reaſon they which are ſeduced by them. It follows not from thence, as our perverted People pretend, that a perſon may be ſaved in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that Worſhip which ruines the Foundation, as they do in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but it follows at leaſt, that a perſon may be ſaved that teaches Doctrines oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Truth, provided that they ſubvert not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: and by conſequence, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, as well as cruel, to damn all thoſe which are out of her Communion for Errors that are light and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling; for having pronounced Anathema againſt thoſe which deny, for example, that Infants dying without Baptiſm are damned, Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> makes no difficulty to condemn all thoſe, which do not believe the ſovereign and abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We have a third proof of the falſeneſs of this Pretence, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is in poſſeſſion of that Unity out of which there is no Salvation, in this,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49990:124"/>That God preſerves the Miniſtry of his Word in many Places, and in many Churches, which do not ſubmit to the Latin Church. The Word of God never returns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect. The Wiſdom of God will not permit, that he ſhould preſerve the Miniſtry in places where there are none but Non-elect and Reprobates; ſo that it is abſurd, that God ſhould cauſe his Goſpel to be preached to a herd of Reprobates, among which there is not one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on whom the Word can produce its effect. It will be therefore in vain, that God ſhould preſerve Chriſtians in all the Eaſt and South, for theſe Chriſtians being out of the ſaving Unity, will be damned juſt in the ſame manner as if they were Pagans.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Schiſm of the Ten Tribes gives us a convincing Proof that in Schiſmatical Churches every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon is not in a ſtate of Damnation. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated ten Tribes from the other two; he would not ſuffer them to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but engaged them in a formal Schiſm; nevertheleſs God there preſerved both Prophets, as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and a multitude of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which he affirmed to be his own, becauſe they had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> There is therefore no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church that has reaſon to boaſt it ſelf of having Unity alone, to the prejudice of all other Churches.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The truth is, that on one ſide the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſtianity in the time of the Apoſtles, and on the other ſide the Pagan Converts lived in a true Schiſm; for theſe Jewiſh Chriſtians would have no Communion with the converted Pagans, nevertheleſs they did not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually damn each other: therefore we ought not to damn thoſe which live in Schiſm, whatever it be. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jews had conſiderable Errors; they obſerved the Law, and would retain Circumciſion with all their might, Things incompatible with Chriſtianity, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> declares ſo poſitively as to ſay, <hi>If any one be circumciſed Chriſt ſhould profit him nothing:</hi> nevertheleſs, God ſuffers and ſaves them with conſiderable Errors. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49990:125"/>true that the Church is ſhut up in one ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that every Error damns when we ſeparate from a Society, that is juſtly called the Church: but it's true, that remaining in a Society bearing that Name, we may nevertheleſs be damned, when there are mortal Errors there, as there are in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, Ask your Converters, who would oblige you to return to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on pain of Damnation, under pretence that Unity is in that Church alone; ask them, I ſay, whether they would pronounce, that all the <hi>Greek</hi> Chriſtians (of whom there are millions) are damned for this only reaſon, becauſe they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who alone has Unity in her poſſeſſion? If they have the front to ſay yea, ask them if they acknowledge the <hi>Greeks</hi> for Chriſtians? They will alſo alſo anſwer you yea: purſue and preſs them, by asking how God can abandon to eternal Damnation an infinite number of Chriſtians, who according to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hold no Capital Errors, and are only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in things of ſmall conſequence? If the Papiſts boaſt of the conſent of all Chriſtians of other Communions, and particularly of the <hi>Geeks,</hi> in the Invocation of Saints, in the Adoration of Images, in the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, the real Preſence and Adoration: they do therefore hold all that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> eſteems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; why therefore will they damn them for little things, and for this alone, that they will not live in this pretended Unity?</p>
               <p>To compleat the confuſion of your Converters, by themſelves, on the ſubject of this Unity, out of which we are departed, Ask them if this Unity be not a certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in which the true Church is encloſed? They will anſwer you yea: proceed to ask them, Whether this certain Circle of Unity has not its Centre, that is to ſay, a certain eminent Church to which all the reſt ought to have their Relation, to the end that they may be within the ci<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cle of Unity? they will alſo anſwer you yea; and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49990:125"/>they will add that the Pope, or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this centre of Unity.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> finds a way to ſecure himſelf from the Thunders of <hi>Rome</hi> by frequent repeating this: and indeed this Suppoſition, according to their Hypotheſis, is of abſolute neceſſity; for if this Circle of Unity have no Centre of Adherence, it vaniſhes immediately; a man will always be able to ſay with good reaſon, To what Church would you that I ſhould adhere? is it to that of <hi>Paris,</hi> or that of <hi>Toledo?</hi> Theſe are particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which may err; if therefore the Pope be ruined, if the neceſſity of Adherence to the Pope be removed, the circle of Unity periſhes with him, which they call the centre of Unity. Now obſerve, that at this day the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the <hi>French</hi> Church, your Converters, ruine the Pope from head to foot; they take away the centre of Unity, and by deſtroying the centre they deſtroy the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. 'Tis to this that ſo many modern Writings of <hi>Maimbourgh, Gerbas, Noel Alexander,</hi> made, after the Kings Declarations, and the Definitions of the Biſhops on this Subject, or in proſpect of them, do tend. But the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church never ſpake ſo openly as ſhe hath done but a little while fince, by the Pen of a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> called <hi>Elias Pin,</hi> touching the ancient Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church.

<list>

                     <item>4. That the Pope has no right to review, and finally judge the Cauſes determined by the Biſhops.</item>
                     <item>5. That the Priviledges which the See of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day enjoys, are not by divine Right, but

                     <item>6. That to be a good Catholick and a good Chriſtian, it is in no wiſe neceſſary, in many Occurrences, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>7. That the Primacy of the Church, which the Pope poſſeſſes, appertains not to him but by a tolerated Uſurpation, or as a Priviledge grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Councils.</item>
                  </list> This gives him no character of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, nor the right of judging finally, and above Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Behold exactly the Divinity of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church at this day; for this man, in the view of the Court, had not written thus without its Order. Behold alſo the centre of Unity intirely ſubverted, and ſo ſubverted as it was by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> This being ſo, why do theſe Gentlemen everlaſtingly beat upon your ears, about their Unity, and the centre of Unity? There is no more Unity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſince there is no centre of it there; for ſince adherence to the Pope is no farther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be a true Chriſtian, you are not departed from Unity and Chriſtianity by departing from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pope: obſerve therefore thereon, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and your Converters, are not men of Fidelity, to preſs you by Principles the falſeneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they themſelves confeſs: for in the Paſtoral letter of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> in his Catholick Expoſition, and every where elſe, to hear him ſpeak of the centre of Unity, you would ſay, that the Pope poſſeſſed this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by divine Right: and behold theſe Gentlemen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to us, That 'tis by a handſome Uſurpation tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by the conceſſion of Councils.

We have treated this matter at large in our Anſwer to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Nicholas,</hi> where we have made it apparent, that

               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have not obliged my ſelf to acquaint you with all the ſad Accidents that do betide us in our Exile and Perſecution: but the death of the excellent Mr. <hi>Claud</hi> is an event ſo grievous, that I cannot forbear ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word concerning it. God hath taken him to himſelf ſince our laſt Letter. He was the Father of our Prophets, and we may well cry after him, <hi>My Father, my
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49990:127"/>Father, the Chariot of Iſrael, and the Horſeman thereof.</hi> God had formerly affixed him in a particular manner to the conduct of the moſt conſiderable of your Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, but Providence made him become in a manner your univerſal Paſtor, by the care that he took to defend you from the dangerous Sophiſtry of thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſeduce you; and he was herein ſucceſsful in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch a manner, as might cover all our Enemies with ſhame and confuſion. I acquaint you with the loſs that you have ſuſtained, that you may lament, and look on it as a mark of the continuation of God's diſpleaſure againſt you. His Juſtice was not yet ſatisfied; the Arrows of his Quiver were not all drawn forth; this ſtroke was ſtill owing to us: I pray God this may be the laſt. If you be grieved, your Enemies (you may be ſure) rejoyce at it; but they muſt know, that if the Aſhes and Blood of the Martyrs hath been the ſeed of the Church, the Tombs of the Prophets do preſerve their Spirit which paſſeth to their Diſciples. If the Grave incloſe the Fleſh and Bones of this great Man, his Writings will preſerve his Wit, Knowledge, and Illuminations; and God will not ſuffer a failure of Perſons, which ſhall propheſie on his Tomb, for the maintenance of thoſe Victories that he hath gained for the Truth. God will do his work in your fight, and you ſhall ſee this Church, which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dead, riſe again after four days: but it may be he will do this work himſelf; and when you ſee thoſe fall and drop away one after another, whoſe Writings and Diſcourſes might be of uſe to ruine the ſucceſs and triumph of Lyes, be perſuaded that God will derive his Praiſe from the mouths of Children; and that he that laid the Foundation of the Kingdom of his Son by Fiſhermen, will re-eſtabliſh the Ruines thereof by earthen Veſſels, into which he will pour his Treaſures. He whoſe loſs we lament, was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilſt he lived, one of thoſe Inſtruments which God ſerved himſelf of, for your Edification and Defence. Whilſt you pour out tears upon his Grave, and throw
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49990:128"/>your ſhowers there, you may gather ſweetneſs thence. <hi>Out of the Eater came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs.</hi> Death, that devours and takes all things from us, cannot hinder us from ſearching and finding our Edification in the Remains of this great Man. His laſt Words will ſerve as a Support to our Faith. It was not the pleaſure of God that he ſhould ſhed his Blood for the defence of his Truth; but he hath made his laſt Words (which are the effuſion of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of his Soul) give Teſtimony to thoſe Truths which he had preach'd and defended. <hi>I have,</hi> ſays he, <hi>laboured all my life in the ſearch of the beſt Religion; and being now about to give up my Soul to God, I do declare, That I have not found any but our own (which I have ſo often defended, and in which I am now about to dye) which is the true way to Heaven.</hi> The Words of dying men are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Voice of Conſcience; for in that laſt moment Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation has no place; ſo that they are the Seal of all the Truths which he hath ſo gloriouſly defended. My deſign will not permit me to ſpeak all on this Subject which it were neceſſary you ſhould know; I ſhall leave it to ſome other Perſon, and return to the matter of our preceding Letters.</p>
            <p>This ſhall conſiſt of one point of Antiquity, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Controverſie. We are to finiſh the Hiſtory of the Chriſtianity of the Third Age. And after we have fortified you againſt the Illuſions which your Seducers frame upon ſome Paſſages of the Writings of St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> on the Subject of Repentance, Auricular Confeſſion, and Satisfaction; I muſt alſo fortifie you againſt the Snares that they compoſe for you from the Writings of the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> on the Subject of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for they do not fail to tell you, That the Fathers neareſt the Apoſtles had a great reſpect for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word; that they did often diſpute againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by Tradition, and that <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That there was no other way of diſputing againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:49990:128"/>
But to ſecure you from this Snare, Learn Firſt, That when <hi>Tertullian</hi> diſputes, and proves that which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances by Tradition, it is almoſt alway about indifferent Ceremonies, and matters of practice. As in the Book concerning the <hi>Soldiers Crown,</hi> where he proves by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the bearing of no Crown upon the Head; of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping three times in Baptiſm; of giving Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to be eaten by the newly baptized; of giving Alms and Oblations for the Dead; of not Waſhing ſeven days after Baptiſm. 'Tis true, that in his Book of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, from the 15th Chapter to the 22th, he proves that we may not diſpute againſt Hereticks by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but by the Tradition of the Churches. And he returns to it again in the 37th and 38th Chapters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But if the new Converts which have written to us, and do ſend us to that Book, had read it with ſome wiſdom and attention of mind, they would have ſeen that it neither doth nor can concern us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Hereticks, concerning whom the queſtion is there, were no Chriſtians, they were Magicians, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who retained the Name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and no m<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> them at a diſtance from the Scriptures, becauſe being no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they did not belong to them.</hi> 2. Theſe Hereticks did not acknowledg the Authority of the Scriptures; they rejected them, or received only ſome pieces of them cut off from the reſt, and which were wholly corrupt and falſified. And when the Catholicks quoted to them the Holy Scripture, they derided it as a fabulous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. How then could any man diſpute with them from a Book whoſe Authority they did not acknowledge? there was a neceſſity of having recourſe to another ſort of proofs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which was good in the time of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is not good at this time of day. I do maintain that it was then very eaſie, and very convenient to diſpute
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49990:129"/>againſt Hereticks by Tradition. It was then not above an hundred years ſince the laſt of the Apoſtles died. There was nothing more eaſie than to learn what had been their Doctrine by their Succeſſors. It is about a hundred and fifty years ſince the Reformed Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> had its exiſtence. If the Doctrin of <hi>Calvin</hi> were now under diſpute, nothing were more eaſie, than to prove without Book, that his Doctrine paſſed without alteration, even to thoſe that now teach in that Church and School. But is it the ſame thing, when there are 1200, 1500, and 2000 years paſt? By what way can we ſearch ſo far, and aſcend ſo high through an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Men, of whom not one hath retained the Doctrine that he did receive, in the ſame eſtate in which it was delivered to him? Behold a very fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. 3. Add to this, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſends us to the Teſtimony of thoſe Churches which were founded by the Apoſtles, becauſe thoſe Churches had the <hi>Authentick Letters</hi> (as he calls them) that is to ſay, the Original Writings of the Apoſtles; ſo that to ſend the Hereticks to the Churches, and to their Teſtimony, (by reaſon of thoſe <hi>Authentick Letters</hi>) was to ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>That the Apoſtles indeed might know all, and agree in the things which they did preach, but they did not reveal all things to all; that they ſaid certain things publickly and to all, but that there were other things which they ſaid in ſecret, and to a few; and that is it which St.</hi> Paul <hi>means, when he ſaith to</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy, <hi>O</hi> Timothy, <hi>keep that good thing which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thee.</hi> Behold exactly the Doctrine of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters, and that of the ancient Hereticks! 'Tis that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> oppoſes, proving that the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered nothing by Tradition, but that which is written. 5. Poor ſilly Fools! which have ſuffered your ſelves to be ſeduced by I know not what ſhadows and appearances, and who put your ſelves to judge of Antiquity without knowing any thing thereof. If you knew againſt what He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks <hi>Tertullian</hi> diſputed, you would ſee that the Contr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie was not about things that were not in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Theſe Hereticks denied, that Jeſus Chriſt was God, and that he was a true Man; They ſaid that he had no true Fleſh, and that his Paſſion was nothing but a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and an appearance of a great many Phantoms; they denied the Reſurrection of the Fleſh. Was there any need to recur to Tradition to prove ſuch things as theſe? Doth not the Scripture contain thoſe Truths that are oppoſite to theſe wicked Imaginations, as clearly as Tradition? And do you not ſee that <hi>Tertullian</hi> forſakes the Scriptures on this Subject only, becauſe the Enemies againſt which he diſputed had forſaken them, and had no reverence for their Authority? 6. To conclude, If there be any hard terms in this Book, attribute them in the firſt place, to the heat of Diſpute, which always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Men too far; ſecondly, to the Genius and <hi>African</hi> manner of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Expreſſions; and learn, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            <p>To conclude, they endeavour to put Scruples in your minds on the Queſtion of the pretended Primacy of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by certain Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> either corrupted, or ill expounded. But that is a buſineſs, the diſcuſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is too long to be handled at this time; yea 'tis above the capacity of moſt of you: only know, that 'tis ſo far from truth, that they did acknowledge the Sovereign Authority of the Pope in that Age; that <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes no ſcruple to ſcoff at the Pretenſions of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to call him in Raillery the <hi>Biſhop of Biſhops,</hi> becauſe of ſome kind of Primacy which he began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. For even in that time, the Myſtery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty began to work.

Judge you whether he acknowledged him for his Superior. Hear how the ſame <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks in the face of a Council aſſembled at <hi>Carthage</hi> in the Year 258. <hi>Let none of us call himſelf Biſhop of Biſhops, or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49990:131"/>endeavour to force his Collegues to a neceſſity of Obedience, by a tyrannical fear and terror, ſeeeng every Biſhop is Maſter of himſelf, and cannot be judged by another Biſhop, nor can he judge other Biſhops.</hi> 'Twas alſo with reſpect to <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> that he ſpake thus. Has any one the front to ſay, That ſpeaking thus he acknowledged him for his Superior? Obſerve that it was no ſmall Affair that was now under debate; 'twas about the Baptiſm of Hereticks, a Queſtion which had made a great noiſe, and which <hi>Stephen</hi> would have decided with too much Authority.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> (after a hundred others of his Communion) to prove the Primacy of the Pope by S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> quotes a Paſſage from his fifty ſecond Epiſtle, which proves that theſe Gentlemen do not fear to make themſelves ridiculous, provided they may ſeem to ſay ſomewhat. 'Tis a Paſſage where he pretends S. <hi>Cyprian ſays, That the Roman Emperor did ſuffer in</hi> Rome <hi>a Prieſt which was his Rival, with more impatience than he ſuffer'd a</hi> Caefar <hi>in his Armies which diſputed the Empire with him;</hi> That is to ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors did impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſuffer that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be called High Prieſt, to the prejudice of that Dignity, which the Emperors aſſumed unto themſelves. So that according to this reckoning, they were jealous of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and look'd upon them as their Rivals in the High Prieſthood. In truth this is more ridiculous than if one ſhould ſay, The King of <hi>England</hi> (who calls himſelf Head of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church) were jealous of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Martin</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians certainly were not above one in a hundred in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time made leſs Figure in the World, than an Incumbent of five hundred Crowns <hi>per annum</hi> makes at this day: for beſides that they were Poor, they were alſo humble. What Agreement could the Emperor, in quality of a Pagan High-Prieſt, have with this pretended High-Prieſt of the Chriſtians? To be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49990:131"/>his Rival, he muſt aſpire to the ſame thing. I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have choſen to have ſaid, That the Muf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i looks on the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as his Rival. The meaneſt Scholar knows that the Word <hi>Aemulus</hi> which ſignifies Rival, ſignifies alſo Enemy; and 'tis clear, that S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> means that that cruel Perſecutor, the Emperor <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> beheld with more Indignation a Prieſt that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Religion, than he would have look'd upon an Enemy that had diſputed the Empire with him. To conclude, although St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhould have intended to compare the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pagan High-Prieſt, it would not follow that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was Head of all the Chriſtians in the World; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt was not Head but of the Religion of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not of the whole Empire.</p>
            <p>'Tis true that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> corrupted the Idea of the Church, and opened a door to the moſt cruel Doctrine that ever was advanced: he made a falſe Idea of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, which he encloſes in one only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion. And becauſe the Unity of one viſible Head was not yet invented, he imagined I know not what Unity of Epiſcopacy, which all the Biſhops did indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually poſſeſs; whereof nevertheleſs they all adminiſtred but a part. This inconſiſtent Imagination gave place afterwards for the Subſtitution of one ſingle Head, to the end that a viſible Head might be given to the Unity of the viſible Communion, which might be the centre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This ſuffices to give you an Idea of the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Third Age; and by this Hiſtory you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what was altered in Doctrine or Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They introduced the uſe of the Sign of the Croſs, at leaſt in private; for we find it not as yet in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts of Religion.

2. The Liturgy of the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> was augmented and increaſed exceedingly by many Prayers, ſo that it became very long; whereas it was plain and ſhort in the firſt and ſecond Age.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There they added, particularly, Oblations and Prayers for the Dead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To Baptiſm they added Unction, whereof hath been made a Sacrament by it ſelf: they added there alſo Milk and Honey, which they gave to the newly bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſome other unprofitable Ceremonies.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They appointed two days of Faſting and Regular Prayers every week: in ſome Places <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> and in other Places <hi>Thurſdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays;</hi> and 'tis from thence the two Fiſh-days came, <hi>viz. Friday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> according to the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They increaſed their rigor of Diſcipline, on the one hand ordaining long Penances to Sinners; and 'tis from thence that the Doctrine of Humane Satisfactions had its birth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. On the other hand, they looſened the rigor of this Diſcipline with reſpect to ſome ſingle perſons, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the value they had for the Letters of Interceſſion written by the Martyrs; and 'tis from thence that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences have their original, and the application of the merit of Saints to thoſe who have not enough of their own.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They began to put a value upon Tradition; and from thence came inſenſibly a contempt of the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They introduced a falſe Idea of the Church and its Unity, by which they put out of the Communion of Jeſus Chriſt, not only Hereticks erring in the Foundation, but all Societies beſpotted with Error, though never ſo little: this is that which has produced ſo many bloody Diviſions, ſo many Anathema's, unjuſt Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Hatreds and Quarrels.</p>

Add all theſe Alterations to thoſe which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved in the ſecond Age, and you will ſee, that the exterior face of Worſhip was already wholly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, although the interior had not yet received any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Alteration: but this change in the exterior part did afterwards wholly ruine the interior, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we cannot deny but from the Third Age Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity hath received a conſiderable Alteration. When they had dreſſed up the Euchariſt after the manner of a Sacrifice, it was not difficult to fall into a perſuaſion that it was one indeed. When they had introduced the words Merit and Satisfaction, they ſoon after changed the firſt ſenſe and meaning of them. When they had eſtabliſhed Prayers for the Dead, it was a good ſtep leading to the Opinion of Purgatory. When they had clothed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with ſo many pompous Ceremonies, that did inſenſibly diſpoſe mens minds to ſearch more than Bread in the matter of it.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:49990:133"/>cannot hurt you, yea that they may ſerve you, provided that you make them means of uniting your ſelves to God. That which makes the Poiſon of this Writing the more dangerous is, That there is mingled in it a character and appearance of Humility, Piety, and Devotion. We are informed, That Perſons, who to make themſelves acceptable at Court do deſign to bring you to a Submiſſion to your Perſecutors, have ſent you many Copies thereof: ſo that we have all ſorts of reaſon to fortifie you againſt the peril unto which this pernicious Writing may thruſt Perſons who have already too much inclination to flatter and lay themſelves to reſt.

With great appearance of Devotion (which is ſeen in all hypocondriack and doting perſons) ſhe puts her ſelf upon Preaching to the World, by eighteen or twenty Volumes of Writings, which ſhe either cauſed to be printed during her Life, or left to be printed after her Death. In theſe Works, beſides Chriſtian Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and particularly what appertains to Morality, which ſhe hath adorned happily enough in ſome Particulars, ſhe puts off a thouſand paradoxical Viſions, and a thouſand empty Dreams againſt the Truths which are received
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49990:133"/>by Divines. Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Author of the Writing of which we are now diſcourſing, more through weakneſs of Mind than corruption of Heart, put himſelf into this Sect, and is become the Head thereof. Thirteen Volumes of his may be ſeen, which without doubt do explicate and much promote the myſteries of his Miſtreſs. It will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to learn you what is the character of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by giving you ſome draughts of their Religion, drawn from that very Writing which hath been ſent unto you. Firſt of all, Their Opinion is to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to be fond of no body, to entertain among them Papiſts, Lutherans, Remonſtrants, the Reformed, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Mennonites, Anabaptiſts. All are there welcome, without being obliged either to change their Opinions or Practices, if they think fit to retain them. But alſo their Religion is, to practiſe nothing externally. They go neither to Sermons, nor to Maſs; they perform no exerciſe of Religion, neither publick nor private. They have no Aſſemblies, as other Sects among Chriſtians. If the humor takes them, they will go this day to Maſs, and to morrow to the Church of the Reformed; but that doth not happen, it may be, once in a year, nor perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture once in all their Life, for they do profeſs a very mean opinion and a great indifference for the exerciſes of Piety, looking on them as things without, which are of no uſe any further than the intention and manner of uſing them (to rectifie the Mind and Conſcience) makes them profitable, yea they do more hurt than good, becauſe they draw the Soul out of it ſelf. I believe that they have in this a great correſpondence with the Followers of Dr. <hi>Molini,</hi> whom they call Quietiſts, and who make a very great noiſe in <hi>Italy.</hi> They reproach the Paſtors exceſſively, and under an appearance of Zeal, there is nothing which they do not ſay, to make odious and contemptible both the publick Miniſtry and thoſe that exerciſe it, in the one and other Religion. This may be ſeen in the Writings of their Foundr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49990:134"/>de Bourignon.</hi> They perform no private Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Devotion in their houſes, at leaſt, which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: for Mr. <hi>P.</hi> himſelf hath made known to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that <hi>Madam Meiſelle de Bourignon</hi> had no Prayers in her Family unleſs it were at Table; and yet he obſerves, that that alſo was done with a low Voice, not that they do not permit the uſe of Prayers to ſuch as will, as they permit them to go to Sermons, or to Maſs indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently: but thoſe which are perfect among them do not concern themſelves about it. And one of the Principles of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> is, That Deſires, Prayers, Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heart towards God, and Meditation, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly contrary to the Spirit of perfect Chriſtianity, and hinder the deſcent of the holy Spirit, and the coming of his Grace. According to him, the only eſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to draw down the holy Spirit, is that which he calls a ſtate of <hi>Inaction,</hi> by which, in a privation of Prayers, Deſires, and Motions, a man lets himſelf fall into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And this annihilation of all the Faculties, is that acceptable Sacrifice to God which cauſes a deſcent of the Holy Spirit. They have perpetually thoſe Words in their mouth, <hi>Let all Creatures keep ſilence, and let God ſpeak;</hi> by which they ſignifie, not only that we ought to impoſe ſilence on our Paſſions, that we may hear God, which is very true, but alſo that we ought to ſhut the doors to all external Objects, and to lay all our internal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties aſleep, to procure a kind of Extaſie, which whilſt it continues, God ſpeaks to the Heart immediately, and by himſelf. Behold one of the Dreams of this Sect; whereof you will ſee ſome footſteps ſcattered here and there throughout the whole Letter; for this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Humiliations, Annihilations, and internal acts of Adherence to God which you are there exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make.</p>
               <p>Behold another Dream of theſe diſeaſed Minds, which is read alſo in this Writing, in the fourth Page thereof, and the ſecond Column: <hi>Moreover,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it muſt be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49990:134"/>remembred, that 'tis ſaid in the Goſpel, That all things are poſſible to him that believes, That Faith can remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and that Jeſus Chriſt always ſaid to Men, Be it unto you according to your Faith. So that if thoſe which officiate, and aſſiſt at the Celebration of the Euchariſt, do believe that Jeſus Chriſt is preſent there, this Faith is ratified by God, and it engages him (beyond his Word and his Promiſes) to make himſelf preſent, as it is believed; and this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſo clear, that I do not doubt but you will comprehend the force thereof.</hi> Muſt not he have a beſotted mind to call this a clear Conception? I will explain it to you. One of the Opinions of this myſterious Cabala is, that originally God created Man maſter of all things, in the literal ſignification of the Words, ſo that he was able to ſtop the Sun in his courſe, to remove the Globe of the Earth, to remove Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by which he doth this, or could do it, is his Faith; for all things are poſſible to him that believes, without any Figure, or Exceptions. The ſtate of Perfection to which Chriſt calls us, is that of Faith, which makes all things poſſible to us: ſo that, at this day, to overturn the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the World, you have no more to do, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you can do it, and it ſhall be done; for 'tis preciſely in the literal ſenſe that they would have us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words of Chriſt, <hi>If you had Faith but as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, you ſhould ſay to this Mountain, be thou removed and caſt into the Sea, and it would be done.</hi> And that it was not a Priviledge of the Apoſtles, but for all Believers. Behold that admirable Conception which he tells you is ſo clear, that <hi>it is impoſſible you ſhould not underſtand the force thereof.</hi> If you don't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand its ſtrength, at leaſt you will underſtand the convenience of it; for when it ſhall pleaſe you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Chriſt is corporeally preſent in your Andiron, and in the Mantle-tree of your Chimney, it will be ſo; and by that means, without going out of your Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-corner, you will go to Maſs, and every one of you,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49990:135"/>by his Faith, will conſecrate and tranſubſtantiate all the Utenſils of his Houſe.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Writing you will find another Dream, which to me ſeems yet more ridiculous. 'Tis in the ſixth Page, and the ſecond Column, on the Subject of Purgatory. <hi>Then when it happens that a Soul departs this Life in the love of God, having nevertheleſs ſome impurities and evil habits in it ſelf, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, or the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Grace of Jeſus Chriſt which comes after death into this Soul to purifie it, or to finiſh its purification from all ſin, finding there, as yet, more or leſs of the remainders of Evil, and of evil Habits and Inclinations, fights with them that he may expell them; this Combat of the purifying Grace of Jeſus Chriſt againſt the evil which is in a Soul very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he would cleanſe from all the remainders of Sin, is not done, nor can be, without great and ſenſible ſorrows.</hi> Is not this very ſingular, That when a Soul is ſeparated from his Body, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould thruſt it ſelf in there, (like Sand to ſcour) to cleanſe this Soul, which is an occaſion of quick and pungent Sorrows. Surely Mr <hi>P.</hi> could not have done better to excite the curioſity of the Publick, than to give us this little ſpark of his Myſteries. This alſo will be worth ſomething to his Printer; for I am aſſured, that the Curious of <hi>France</hi> would at any rate whatſoever ſee a compleat Syſteme of this admirable Theology.</p>
               <p>However it be, it is not without a particular Providence that it happens, that in a Writing, otherwiſe apt enough to flatter the minds of our <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> the Author hath ſufficiently diſcovered himſelf, and made known what he is. After this, my Brethren, judge what credit you ought to give a man, who gives you an Idea of Piety according to which the Iſraelites might worſhip the Golden Calf without fault, becauſe they believed it to be God; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, a Man may be a <hi>Turk,</hi> and adore even Cabages, provided he makes uſe of them as a means of uniting him to God, and to excite his Love. Theſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49990:135"/>Gentlemen deſire of us to leave them in peace; let them leave us ſo then, and let them not intermeddle to give Advice to our Congregations, being not called thereto. With all my heart, I am willing to leave them at reſt, for I take no pleaſure to trouble any body; and I will leave them in their Retirement very peaceably, provided they put themſelves into a ſtate of <hi>Inaction,</hi> as well in reſpect to us as to God; but if they continue to trouble us, the Diſpute may have an Iſſue which will not turn to their honor.</p>
               <p>This Digreſſion, which hath been longer than I could have wiſhed, will be the cauſe that we cannot proceed far in the Article of Controverſie. We are on the true Idea of Unity. The laſt part of our preceding Letter was employed in refuting the falſe Idea of Unity. We have made it appear, that 'tis a fooliſh and cruel Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to ſhut up Salvation in any ſingle Communion, and that of all the Sects of Chriſtianity, that of <hi>Rome</hi> has the leaſt right to pretend to it. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> brags much of four or five Paſſages of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prove this cruel Paradox. This ancient Doctor goes ſo far as to ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitate.</note> 
                  <hi>That there can be no Martyr but in the Church; that when a man is ſeparated from its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, 'tis in vain that he ſheds his blood for the Confeſſion of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This Maxim, in a large ſignification, may be endured; for indeed there may be Hereticks, who confeſſing the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, but on the other ſide ruining the Foundations of the Chriſtian Religion, may dye for the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt to no advantage: but the Application which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes thereof, is one of thoſe faults over which wiſe men ought to draw a Curtain. He proceeds ſo far as to apply it to the <hi>Novatians.</hi> Now it muſt be known, theſe <hi>Novatians</hi> were good Chriſtians, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times better than are the Papiſts, ſeeing they did not ruine any of the Foundations, but retained and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all the Chriſtian Verities: only they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49990:136"/>ſevere in Diſcipline, and would not receive thoſe that fell in times of Perſecution to the Peace of the Church. Was not this a great crime? Was not this a fine occaſion to ſay, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, <hi>That a Novation was no Chriſtian?</hi> Was not this a very fine Foundation for that terrible and cruel Sentence, That a <hi>Novation</hi> dying a Martyr for Jeſus Chriſt, was nevertheleſs damned? Of what make and conſtitution are the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that make uſe of theſe Exceſſes, which ought to be hid out of Honor to thoſe great men which fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Theſe are Scars remaining in their Fleſh, to the end that we ſhould not exalt them too much by reaſon of their great Virtues. Behold, my Brethren, the eye wherewith Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> looks on you: he, for your ſakes, makes uſe of the eyes which St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had for the <hi>Novatians,</hi> concerning whom he ſaid, <hi>A Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is out of the Church, he is no Chriſtian.</hi> So ſays Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> concerning you, <hi>The Calviniſts are out of the Church, and are no Chriſtians.</hi> And why then, Gentlemen, do you addreſs to us Paſtoral Letters? Why do you call us your wandring Brethren? Will you dare to ſay, that we are no Chriſtians? Let theſe Writers of Paſtoral Letters, ſays Mr. <hi>de Meaux, who ſhrowd themſelves with ſome ſhreds of</hi> S. Cyprian, <hi>take all his Doctrine entire.</hi> Go to Mr. you may ſay unto him, If you find the Doctrine of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſo good, why don't you take it whole and entire? Why don't you ſay that all the <hi>Greeks</hi> and all the Chriſtians of the Eaſt are not Chriſtians? Dare you ſay that all the <hi>Greeks</hi> which have been martyred by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens</hi> ſince the Tenth Age are damned, and that they did not ſuffer Martyrdom although they ſuffered for Jeſus Chriſt? For my part, I am perſuaded, that if you preſs your Converters on this Subject with their Paſſages of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> they will bluſh on both Cheeks. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore, with reſpect to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the love which he had for the Peace of the Church, and the horror that he had for Schiſm, ran him into that exceſs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49990:136"/>or ſay, That out of that, I know not what, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Unity of the Church, a man could not be ſaved. 'Twas in this Age that men began to corrupt the Idea of the Church, as I have already obſerved.</p>
               <p>To what will all this come, and what profit will you draw thence, my Brethren? 'Tis that thereby you will prove to your Converters the falſeneſs of this Doctrine, That the Unity of the Church is included in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that out of this Church, or in any other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Communion, there is no Salvation; and thereby you will convince them, that they are not infallible: for if this Article be falſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church alone poſſeſſes that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſhe hath erred, and that in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and capital Affair. You will alſo thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion is the moſt cruel, and the moſt damnable of all the Sects of Chriſtianity, foraſmuch as it condemns the moſt men: For by defming that ſhe alone poſſeſſes ſaving <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and by condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe that are not in this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> ſhe damns three fourth parts of the Chriſtian World.

                  </list> Let Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be ſeparated, and ſet at a diſtance one from another as far as the <hi>Antipodes</hi> are from us, let them have no knowledge one of another, They will not ceaſe to be one by this triple <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Spirit, Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If there were a pure Church in the fartheſt part of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or in the utmoſt part of <hi>China,</hi> we ſhould be one Church with them, though we had never heard any thing ſaid one of another. It is not therefore the Unity of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> of <hi>Worſhip, Diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> which makes the <hi>Eſſential <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> that's an accidental Unity, which a man may break without going out of the true Unity. So the <hi>Novatians</hi> which were ſeparated from the Church for a little unhappy point of Diſcipline, were in the wrong no doubt, and greatly in the wrong, and <hi>Novatian</hi> above all, who was the firſt Author of that Separation. But 'tis a ridiculous Chimera, to imagine that they were out of the Eſſential Unity, ſeeing that when they went away, they carried with them the true Jeſus, the true Doctrine, and the true Sacraments. They were yet the Church; they were Chriſtians, whatever St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays of them: and not only their Martyrs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Crown of Martyrdom, but their penitent Chriſtians obtained Salvation, although they died in Schiſm. There are particular Unities, and a general Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Particular Unity conſiſts in certain Bonds, ſuch as are common Eccleſiaſtick Government, common Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and certain common Ceremonies. You are not in particular Unity with the Epiſcopal <hi>Church of England</hi> with reſpect to Government. But this Unity ſignifies nothing to Salvation: he muſt be a mad man to damn Chriſtians becauſe they either have or have not Biſhops. The general Unity, which conſiſts in the three things which I have ſaid, is the only eſſential, neceſſary, and ſaving Unity. If you agree with the Church in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49990:137"/>Diſcipline, and Ceremonies, and don't agree with it in Opinions, in Sacraments, and Spirit, you have no Communion with it; if you differ in Government and Diſcipline, and agree in Truths, Sacraments, and the ſame Jeſus, you are at Unity. with it, and with God.</p>
               <p>This <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church, whereof we have now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed, makes me think of that unity of Souls which ought to prevail among the true Members of the Body of Chriſt. It is the Character under which the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church is deſcribed unto us, <hi>They were all of one heart, and one mind.</hi> 'Tis this holy Unity which draws down the holy Spirit; for when the firy Tongues fell upon the Apoſtles, they were all with one accord aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in one place. 'Tis the abſence of this holy Unity which in part hath drawn down thoſe unhappy Effects of the Wrath of God under which we now groan. Call to mind the Diviſions, the immortal Hatreds, Jealouſies, Quarrels, and Strifes, which have been ſeen in the midſt of you, even on occaſions, and in things, for which Peace, and the Spirit of Charity were particularly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One was of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Peter,</hi> but not one for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Men made their own Paſſions and Intereſts to triumph, and trampled under foot the Glory of God, and the publick Edification. The ſtricteſt friendſhips were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to break on the firſt tranſport of Paſſion. The Spirit of Vengeance had no reſt, till it had revenged the Injuries it thought it had received; and we knew not what it was to ſacrifice a reſentment to the Love of God, and his Chriſt. God has made theſe civil Wars to ceaſe by a cruel and ſtrange War. You have a common tye more than you have had: you have had the ſame Faith, the ſame Sacraments, the ſame Churches, and the ſame Holy Table; beſides, you have at this day your common Affliction, and your common Misfortunes. 'Tis certain, that even in the World this makes a tye among Souls, and it ſhould do, with far greater reaſon, when men ſuffer the ſame grief, for the ſame cauſe, and for the ſame
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49990:138"/>God. You ought mutually to love each other, becauſe you are afflicted for God; and by conſequence, you ought to love thoſe alſo who ſuffer for you: they are your Confeſſors, who have the glory to maintain, in the Priſons, thoſe Truths with you have been ſo weak only to keep cloſe in your Hearts, having not the courage to ſhew them openly. Among thoſe which are in divers Priſons of the Realm, for the Cauſe of God, there are an infinite number that want all things: theſe are Voices that cry againſt you to Heaven in a terrible manner, and ſay, What a ſhame is it that Jeſus Chriſt is in Priſon, that he is Sick, Hungry, and Thirſty, that he freezes with cold during the rigor of the Winter, and that theſe <hi>Peters,</hi> who grew pale at the word of a Servant, don't go to viſit him, to give him Bread and Cloaths. You know what will be the Sentence that the Lord will give to ſuch; think of it, and partake-in the Bonds of your Brethren, though they be at the utmoſt ends of the Kingdom.</p>

            <head>The TWELFTH PASTORAL LETTER. AN Article of Antiquity. The beginning of the Hiſtory of Chriſtianity of the Fourth and Fifth Ages. Of the Original of Monks. An Article of Controverſie. Of the Unity of the Miniſtry.</head>
            <p>HAving finiſhed the Hiſtory of the Chriſtianity of the Third Age, we enter upon the Fourth. We ſhall not diſtinguiſh that of the Fourth and Fifth, they are ſo interwoven, that they cannot be ſeparated. All the Superſtitions, falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Corruptions of Diſcipline, which are found eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Fifth Age, took their beginning in the Fourth. We enter upon Ages in which the Church had entirely changed its Face; it is no longer a perſecuted Church; it triumphs, it reigns, it aſcends the Throne. The Emperors becoming Chriſtians, drew along with them by their Authority and Examples, an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pagans, who had that Complaiſance and Civility for their Maſters, as to become Chriſtians. But the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49990:139"/>Church alſo on her part, had the Complaiſance to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Religion with vain Worſhip and Ceremonies bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from Paganiſm: All that which ſhe thought might be innocently taken from thence, ſhe took to draw them over to her. The Biſhops inrich'd by the Liberality of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and his Succeſſors, became proud, they would have a diſtinct Juriſdiction from the Civil; they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for themſelves Tribunals. It appears by the Book of Conſtitutions, falſely aſcribed to the Apoſtles, that the Biſhops had Flatterers which ſaid of them, or rather they ſaid of themſelves, many incredible, proud, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent things.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Vit. Conſt.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 37, &amp; 38.</note> They ſet themſelves above Kings; they ſaid that they muſt pay them Tributes and Tenths, and that Men owed them greater Honors than Kings, and that they had power to condemn to everlaſting Fire. Above all, the Pomp and Pride of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ruling City, became ſuch, that they gave jealouſie to the Chief Magiſtrates of the Empire.</p>
            <p>They added to the Sacraments new Ceremonies, an Unction before Baptiſm, beſide that which followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; the Prayers and Ceremonies of the Liturgy of the Euchariſt, which they call at this day the Maſs, were much increaſed and augmented; they made uſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Waters; they conſecrated Oyls and Chriſm; their Funerals were enriched with Ceremonies borrowed from Judaiſm or Paganiſm; they had their Ninth day, their Fortieth day, and their yearly Obits or Prayers for the Dead; they affixed Prayers to certain hours, which at this day they call <hi>Canonical, the Cock crowing, Nine of the Clock, Mid-day, Three of the Clock, and Veſpers.</hi> In theſe Ages they did eſſentially alter Divine Service, by intermingling therewith the Service of Creatures. A kind of Furie for Relicks ſeized on the Spirits of Men, nothing was heard to be ſpoken of but Viſions, by which they had been diſcovered, and Miracles which had been done by them; they carried them in pomp, they kiſſed
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49990:139"/>them, and built Churches to them; They prayed unto Saints, they relyed upon their Interceſſion, they put themſelves under their protection. To conclude, as the time of the manifeſtation of the Man of Sin drew near, and Chriſtianity to be eſtabliſhed, all things moved to wards it with prodigious ſpeed.</p>
            <p>There was nevertheleſs a profound divine Providence which appeared then, and deſerves to be admired, and to which we can never give ſufficient attention. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity, which then advanced it ſelf, was not to ruine Chriſtianity, nor overturn the Foundations thereof. It was to be built upon thoſe Foundations which were to remain entire from Age to Age. To ſet theſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Chriſtian Religion in ſecurity, God permitted that they ſhould be violently aſſaulted by Hereticks, and zealouſly defended by the Orthodox. The Arrians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Eternal God-head of the Son; the Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that of the Holy Spirit; the Neſtorians gave him two Perſons as well as two Natures, that is to ſay, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the Hereſie of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> and <hi>Photinus,</hi> who made a ſimple or mere Man of Chriſt Jeſus. This is a thing which ſome Perſons at this time have not well conſidered, who excuſe <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and his Hereſie. It ſeems to me, that 'tis eaſie to comprehend, that he which places a human Perſon in Chriſt, makes of him a mere Man: For if the joyning the Divine Nature be not made in a perſonal Union, it can be no more than a Union of Grace and Aſſiſtance, ſuch as is that of inſpired Men. The Eutychians, by an oppoſite Error, confound the two Natures. All theſe Hereſies gave opportunity for the clearing theſe matters, and ſetting the Foundations of the Chriſtian Religion in great light and in lovely order, and fortifying them with the conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. This is it which produced divers Creeds beſides that of the Apoſtles, which is too general. If Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had not taken this care and precaution, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which came a great pace, had entirely ruined
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49990:140"/>the Chriſtian Religion; for beſides theſe Fundamentals, whereof God had taken care and ſet them in ſafety, in three or four Ages their remained nothing elſe ſound in the Church.</p>
            <p>We will not therefore buſie our ſelves in reckoning all the Changes which happened in Religion during theſe Ages, that would carry us too far, and would not be peradventure very profitable for you; we will ſtay our ſelves only on the moſt conſiderable Innovations: For example, we ought not to forget, that it was in the Fourth and Fifth Age that Monaſtick Life had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Thoſe among the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which will grant us nothing, make it deſcend from <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jab,</hi> the Rechabites, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apoſtles; but this Opinion is ſo difficult to be maintained, that I do not know whether, at this day, any Men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which make any pretence to ſincerity, will deny that this kind of Life had <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> for its firſt Authors, who during the Perſecutions of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> in the beginning of the Fourth Age, or about the end of the Third, withdrew themſelves into the Deſart of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> and were followed thither by many Men, and there began that which they call the Eremetick Life. It muſt be, that this truth is plain in Hiſtory, ſince many Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, notwithſtanding the Intereſt they have to maintain the antiquity of this Inſtitution, do confeſs that it is but of the Third and Fourth Age.

'Tis true, that in the preceding Ages, the Fathers tell us of Virgins conſecrated to God; yea, and of Men who preſerved their Virginity, and lived in a chaſte Celibate, to the end they might ſerve God with greater freedom; but this hath nothing common with the Life of the Monks and Nuns of the preſent Age. Theſe young Damoſels were not cloyſtered; it appears by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> Epiſt. 72.</note>, that they might marry when they pleaſed, that they lived with their Friends, or in their own Houſes. And even in the time of S. <hi>Jerome</hi> the moſt part of them were ſo little reſtrained, that they made and received Viſits, they went to Weddings, they were found at Feaſts, they went to the Baths, they adorned themſelves with the ſame Pride and the ſame Exceſs as did the Daughters of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> having been driven by Perſecutions into the Deſarts, did there firſt eſtabliſh the Hermetick Life: Afterwards they formed there ſome kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and Societies. So they inſtituted in the Deſart a kind of Cenobitick Life; but this kind of Life received its moſt perfect Figure about the end of the Fourth Age, by three Biſhops, whereof two were Hereticks, and the third Orthodox; one of theſe Hereticks was <hi>Marathon</hi>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49990:141"/>of any other Order in the Eaſt, but of that of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> whereas in the Weſt there is an infinity of Orders.</p>
            <p>We doubt not many of thoſe, and theſe, who in the beginning engaged themſelves in this kind of Life, did do it with a good intention, yea, and there led a Life eminently Holy: But as God does not bleſs Inſtitutions which reſpect Religion, which are but humane, we may obſerve that the Spirit of Darkneſs, and we may ſay, a Spirit of Malediction, fell upon this Inſtitution, even from its beginning. It was not above a hundred years after there had been diſcourſe of Monks and Nuns, but the Spirit of Fables, and Legends had ſeized on their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. S. <hi>Jerome</hi> hath left us the Life of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion,</hi> two Founders of the Monaſtick Life: Theſe Lives are written in good Latin, but with ſo little judgment and truth, that we may be aſhamed thereof, for the ſake of ſo great a man. There is the Life of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> attributed to <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> which is alſo a Spiritaal Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, made up of Stories which do no Honor neither to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> nor S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> nor in general to the Chriſtian Religion. I know not what Spirit of Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm and Melancholy, does mingle it ſelf therein; they had, or they feigned themſelves to have Viſions, the Devils appeared to them, they tempted and ſollicited them to fleſhly Sins, and when they could not prevail upon them, they beat them cruelly.

Behold what was the Character of the Monks of the Fourth Age, and behold that which at this time men report to the Honor of theſe poor Ideots, which did paſs for great Saints, or of theſe Hypocrites which did impoſe upon mankind.</p>
            <p>But can a Man read without horror that which <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi> reports concerning the cuſtoms and manner of Life of the Monks of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the time that the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia</hi> Wife of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger went thither? Some of them made a War upon themſelves ſo cruel, that oftentimes they remained upon the ground without appearance of Life, and were taken for unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Carcaſes; others lodged themſelves in Holes where they could neither lye nor ſtand; others hid themſelves in Caves, and made it a piece of Devotion to live among wild Beaſts; others, both Men and Women, ſtript them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked, covering only their ſhameful Parts, and in this nakedneſs expoſed themſelves to be roaſted in the Beams of the Sun from Morning to Evening in the Summer, and in the Winter they continued in the ſame eſtate, expoſing themſelves to the ſevereſt rigors of cold, they ate nothing of what Men do uſe to eat, they fed on Graſs like Oxen, they were alſo called <hi>Boſcoi, i. e.</hi> Eaters of Herbs; and in time they became altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Beaſts, not preſerving the very appearance of Men, and human ſhape; if they ſaw Men afar off, they ran to hide themſelves, as from Bears in ſome Cave, or they ſecured themſelves upon Rocks with the ſwiftneſs of a wild Goat. But all this is nothing in compariſon of what <hi>Evagrius</hi> adds, There are Monks who to make it appear, that they had extinguiſhed Concupiſcence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed in the World promiſcuouſly, Men and Women all naked, they went into Brothel Houſes, into the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous places, they lay together both Men and Women, the Men bathed themſelves with Women, and Women with Men, and all this in publick view without Shame,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49990:142"/>and without covering their Faces. Beſides the Madneſs, is there not Impudence in theſe Devotions, and muſt not a Man have a depraved taſte in matters of Piety, to look on theſe Extravagancies with admiration, as at that time they did?</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the Spirit of Lying and Error ſeized on theſe Men; a Man may ſay truly, that all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations of the Chriſtian Religion did take their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from Monks. In the Fifth and Sixth Age they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> and Originiſts; and thoſe who have any knowledg of the Hiſtory of the Church, do know, that they ſtirred up many Troubles there. They maintained their Opinion and their Friends, not only by Words and Clamors, but by Blows. <hi>Socrates</hi> reports, that during the Controverſies that <hi>Cyril</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> had with <hi>Oreſtes</hi> Governour of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Soc.</hi> lib. 11. cap. 14.</note>, five Hundred Monks came from the Mountain <hi>Nitria</hi> to the City, for the aſſiſtance of <hi>Cyril</hi> their Biſhop: They ſtirred up a Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Governour; one of theſe Monks, called <hi>Ammonius,</hi> gave him a knock on the Head with a Flint, whereby he loſt a great deal of Blood. There are no Hereſies or Superſtitions, of which they may not be called the Authors, 'tis they which introduced the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of invocating Saints and adoring Relicks. <hi>Eunapius</hi> a Pagan Author, who lived at the end of the Fourth Age, ſaith, <hi>That in</hi> Egypt <hi>they appointed Monks in the Village</hi> Cannopus <hi>to worſhip Slaves;</hi> ſo they called the Martyrs. And S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in the Book concerning the <hi>Work of Monks,</hi> ſays, That in his time a Swarm of Monks ſcattered themſelves abroad every where, and made Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of the Bones of Martyrs. It was they who brought Images into the Church, and that Worſhip which gives ſo much Grief to Souls, which are jealous of the Love of God, and ſo much Scandal to Chriſtians. Alſo in the War between the Breakers of Images, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of Images, they were the principal Agents. The Monks at this day think it an Honor to acquaint us with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49990:143"/>the Combats, and the Travels which the Men of their Order have ſuſtained to hinder the Worſhip of Images from falling. 'Twas in the Convent of <hi>Corbie,</hi> and in the Brains of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> the Monk, that the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> had its Birth. When that new ſort of Monks which are called Mendicants came into the World; a Man cannot tell the Evils which they cauſed there, the Superſtitions that they brought, and the Corruptions which they introduced into it. It is from them that thoſe Exceſſes (whereof the honeſt Men of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves, at this day, have an abhorrence) took their Original: Theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, ſay I, which reſpect the Worſhip of the bleſſed Virgin, the Invocation of Saints, and the Adoration of Images and Relicks; Exceſſes which are gone ſo high by the aſſiſtance of the Monks, that all which is moſt odious in Pagan Idolatry, did never go beyond it. 'Tis that whereof your Converters themſelves are at an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with us, 'tis of that which they tell you that we ought to make no uſe, that we ought not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thoſe things to the Church, which were the fooliſh imaginations of the <hi>Friers</hi> of the laſt Ages, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of Monks, as they themſelves call them, and that honeſt Men did never approve. 'Tis a thing far enough from Truth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved theſe Exceſſes. But it is not a thing upon which we have any p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rpoſe to ſtay at preſent: It is ſufficient for you that it is evil by the confeſſion of your Converters, and that this Corruption took its original from Monks.</p>
            <p>They are the ſame Men which have diſhonored Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity by a an Hiſtorical <hi>Theology</hi> more ſhameful and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous than was that of the Pagans and Poets: 'Tis to them that we owe the <hi>Legends,</hi> the Lives of Saints, the Ch<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onicles, and Annals, the Orders of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> in which Works, the leaſt trace of Truth and Purity is not to be ſeen, but a heap of ridiculous Fictions, impertinent Miracles, and filthy Fables, whereof at this day Men of the Character of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49990:143"/>
               <hi>Canus</hi> Biſhop of the Canaries, and <hi>de Launoy</hi> are aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and make no ſcruple to confute them in all their Shapes and Forms. Do not theſe Gentlemen alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the Monks have been always the Inſtruments of the Violence of Popes, and the Incendiaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom? They were the Men that preached the Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades againſt pretended Hereticks: 'Twas they that kindled the Fires, and committed the Maſſacres: They were thoſe that mutinied the People againſt thoſe Kings and Emperors that would not obey the Pope: They were they that ſeized on the Rights of Biſhops, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Pope in all thoſe ways whereof he ſerved himſelf to oppreſs the other Biſhops. They have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn themſelves from the Authority of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, by Immunities obtained in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They have withdrawn Confeſſions from the ordinary Paſtors: They were the Maſters of the Chairs, and publick Teachers during the ſpace of four Hundred or five Hundred Years. To conclude, 'tis certain they have always been the moſt potent Supports of that Throne of Iniquity which hath raiſed it ſelf in the Church.</p>
            <p>For their Manners, I can make it appear by Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that cannot be reproached, that never were Lives ſo debauched as thoſe of the Monks, that during more than ſeven or eight Hundred Years, they were the Sinks of all the Impurities that could be imagined, and we have the Confeſſion of the <hi>Arnolds,</hi> the <hi>Maimbourghs,</hi> and other famous Defenders of Popery in this Age con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. They add that it is not ſo now, and that the Convents at this day are well governed, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick Life very clean and innocent. He muſt be very bold to advance a matter of Fact ſo little known: If there be ſome Convents reformed, there are a great many others that are not ſo.</p>
            <p>I have a little enlarged my ſelf on this Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the original of Monks, their Hiſtory, their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49990:144"/>and their Conduct, becauſe I know 'tis a Snare in which many Perſons ſhut up in Convents have unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fall'n. They have written to us from thence, that they have been much moved with the great Piety which they have found in theſe Houſes, with the Mortification of the Nuns, with their conſtancy in Prayer, with their Humility, with the continual elevation of their Hearts to God, and with their entire renunciation of the World. And they have given us to underſtand, that this hath been the principal Motive of their Converſion. And even very devout and pious perſons, who, thanks be to God, do yet perſevere in the Truth, have not been able to eſcape ſome ſurprize, by theſe fair Appearances and Formalities. God is witneſs that we have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to leſſen the Reputation of any Perſon in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and yet much leſs of theſe Nuns, of whom ſo much good is ſpoken, we wiſh that there were more of truth therein. And if it be ſo, that there is ſo much virtue in Some of them, we hope that God will not ſuffer them to die in the ſad eſtate wherein they are. But we do adviſe our Brethren and Siſters to be on their guard, and beware of this Temptation, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Firſt, That theſe Mortifications wherewith they ſeem to be ſo much charmed are human Devotions, upon which God doth not pour down his Bleſſing. It may be ſeen by that which we have reported concerning the Mortifications of the firſt Monks, how far this miſerable Spirit of ſuperſtition and falſe Devotion may go. That kind of Life obſerved by the Monks of <hi>Attrappe,</hi> for example, doth not find its Original or Model in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and they are thoſe Worſhips of which it will be ſaid, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> We muſt not make it a thing of Merit to be more wiſe than God, than Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and do more than they have done. It is a folly and madneſs to believe that a Man is more acceptable to God, by ſhutting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in a place where he may ſee no body, where
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49990:144"/>he ſpeaks to no body, where he renounces his Friends and Relations, where he deprives himſelf of the ſociety of good Men, whoſe converſation might aſſiſt his piety. 2. I do intreat them to conſider, that in theſe kind of things the <hi>falſe Religions</hi> go farther than that which is true. Ask your Converters, and they will not deny, that the Mortifications of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Monks, and thoſe of the penitent <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Mexicans,</hi> are infinitely more cruel to the Body than are thoſe of our moſt mortified <hi>Europeans;</hi> ſo they are at leaſt equivocal things, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to which, we muſt be extreamly upon our guards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third place it muſt be known, That there are depths in the conduct of God, which cannot be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed: 'tis his pleaſure that we walk always in the midſt of Thorns, and among Snares: 'tis for this reaſon, that in the true Church there be ſo many Scandals, ſo much Negligence, ſo much Indevotion, ſo many Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, ſo much Luxury, ſo little Reformation of Life, and ſo little Zeal for the converſion of thoſe which go aſtray and wander. 'Tis for the ſame reaſon that he permitted the <hi>Reformers</hi> to have their faults, that they did not agree together, and that they intermingled hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Paſſions in their conduct: and on the other ſide, for the ſame reaſon God permits that in Churches the moſt corrupt both in Doctrine and Worſhip, there be Souls that ſeem to ſeek ſeriouſly their Salvation, who have at leaſt the appearance of Chriſtian Virtues, and it may be good Intentions. If the true Doctrine were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied by a holy life, and an edifying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in thoſe that follow it; and that on the other hand, Error and Superſtition were never found without diſorder and an ill life, the choice would be too eaſie: Where would be the difficulty? Where would be the ſnares? Where would be the danger of wavering? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, who will lead his Elect to his end by obſcure ways, that they may have recourſe to him for his light; by rough Paths, that they may ſupport themſelves on
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49990:145"/>him, ſuffers this mixture and confuſion of good and evil, of evil Doctrine and good Manners, of good Doctrine and evil Manners. 'Tis his pleaſure, by this profound conduct, to oblige us to regulate our Faith, not by Prejudices, but by his holy Rules and Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, once more, though I condemn no Perſon in particular, nevertheleſs, I conjure you, my Brethren and Siſters, to ſtand at a defiance with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie: 'tis a grand Comedy, and an inexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Illuſions; 'tis the Character of Perſons that live in Convents, and a Character that has prevailed for a great number of Ages. I could produce to you Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes concerning it, againſt which nothing can be ſaid; <hi>Arnald d' Villeneve, Nicholas de Clemangis,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> and an infinite number of other Popiſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, have made deſcriptions of the humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Appearances of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> which hid and diſguiſed an Abyſs of Pride and Impurity. Do you think, my dear Siſters, which are in Convents, that you ſee the inward part of the Houſes where you are, and of the Souls with whom you converſe? Do you not think, in the firſt place, that the Perſons with which you are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced have order to ſhew themſelves to you on the faireſt ſide, and that they do not take care of letting you ſee their Faults, their Jealouſies, their Quarrels, their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, their Luſts, their Mirths, if they have any? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, Do not you apprehend, that they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Houſes which they know to be beſt governed to lodge you in, and that you ought not to judge of all Convents by thoſe in which you are? If you read the Relations of thoſe which have travelled in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> they will inform you, That in thoſe Countries, thoſe Houſes that are called Religious are infamous Places, where the moſt criminal Debaucheries are exerciſed with Impunity. Thoſe of <hi>France</hi> are leſs irregular: but ſo it is, that we do not at all know the inſide of them; but when the curtain is drawn never ſo little, we ſee that 'tis
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49990:145"/>there almoſt as 'tis elſewhere. The Buſineſs of the Nuns of St. <hi>Claire</hi> and of <hi>Provence</hi> againſt the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> of the ſame place, which was pleaded a little more than twenty years ago, informs us thereof, and makes it apparent, That at that time, all the Convents of Nuns under the Government of the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> in what place of <hi>France</hi> ſoever they were, were places of Proſtitution. This is of no ancient date. Behold the original of Monks, which have cauſed ſo many Evils.</p>

               <p>WE having refuted, in our two preceding Letters, the Fallacy which your Converters take from the Unity of the Church. Before we leave the matter of Unity, we muſt ſay ſomething of the Unity of the Miniſtry: for that alſo is another ſource of the Illuſions of your Converters. The Miniſtry of the Church is one, and only one, ſay they; it hath proceeded from Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; they have delivered to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors that which they received from the Lord; theſe delivered it to others: at length, this only Miniſtry is come to us, and he that hath not Communion with us hath no Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, of whom we are the only legitimate Succeſſors and Ambaſſadors. Is it poſſible that men ſhould be capable of ſuffering themſelves to be cheated by ſo great a Chimera? Certainly if we did not ſee this we could not believe it. That men of good ſenſe ſhould be capable of believing that God hath tied Salvation to a Succeſſion of men, which hang upon each other, and are faſtened tail to tail like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, in ſuch a manner, that out of this file of men, there is no Salvation, whatever a man does or ſays.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49990:146"/>hazard, birth, and a thouſand other accidents, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them from being born and living under this thread or chain of certain Doctors which call themſelves the <hi>Succeſſive Biſhops from Jeſus Chriſt even to us.</hi> That is to ſay, that in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Meaux,</hi> for example, there hath been no Salvation but for thoſe who have been preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Paſtoral Staff from Mr. St. <hi>Faron</hi> unto Mr. <hi>Boſſuet,</hi> who ſhall be alſo one day Mr. St. <hi>Boſſuet,</hi> if the Gods which rule at <hi>Rome</hi> favour him. In the extent of the whole World, he who hath not lived under the long Succeſſion of thoſe Biſhops which have ſat at <hi>Rome,</hi> from St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI. is damned as certainly as the Devil; be it that he that been chaſte as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> patient as <hi>Job,</hi> zealous as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> orthodox as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> pure as the Virgin: for there is but one Miniſtry, and out of this Miniſtry all are in a ſtate of Perdition. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have a Miniſtry, they have Biſhops, and thoſe true Biſhops. According to Mr. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> they hold all the Doctrine of the Church; they believe. Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf: for we have good teſtimonies, that they have been well paid for it in theſe laſt days: but that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing, they are all damned, becauſe they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him who is the centre of the Unity of the Miniſtry; they are not under that one Miniſtry which alone is ſaving. I do maintain, that the time will come, when we ſhall no more believe that which we ſee at this day. It will be ſaid, you would fain make us believe it, you would perſuade us that the men of paſt Ages have loſt their ſenſe; yea, I do maintain they muſt have loſt it to ſuffer themſelves to be deluded with ſuch Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It muſt be that the Medicine be given thee by ſuch a hand, if thou wilt be healed, elſe it will poiſon thee. Ah! my Brethren, open your eyes upon this folly, and be aſhamed thereof. Be aſſured, that every hand which gives you the true Doctrine, is good in that reſpect; the ſaving Remedy of Truth heals from whomſoever it comes. Where is this pretended Unity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Miniſtry?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49990:146"/>Where was this Miniſtry, and this Unity of Miniſtry, during the ſpace of a hundred and fifty years, in the Tenth Age and half the Eleventh? a time in which <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and all the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, do confeſs to us, that the Popes were Monſters, Ungodly, Wicked, Adulterers, Magicians, Poiſoners, Simoniacks, and Blaſphemers. 'Tis the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Hiſtory it ſelf which teacheth us this. Was not this a very fine centre of Unity? The Lines which proceed from this Centre to the Circumference, were they not very clean? The Rays which beam from ſuch a Star, do they not pour down benign Influences? Theſe were the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles. Bleſſed Succeſſors! They left what they did receive; they gave one another an infamous Miſſion (irregular and againſt the Canons) by the Miniſtry of two Whores which ruled at <hi>Rome.</hi> Behold the brave <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and Succeſſion of this pretended Miniſtry. What became of this glorious Unity of the Miniſtry in the time of the Weſtern Schiſm, when we ſaw, for the ſpace of fifty years, a Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and another at <hi>Avignon,</hi> which damned one another, of which one was the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, and the other of Antichriſt, who not only mutually damned each other, but alſo thouſands of millions of Men which lived in the different Obedience of <hi>Avignon</hi> and <hi>Rome?</hi> What a fine thing was this, to ſee <hi>two Centres of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity?</hi> How finely at eaſe would Mr. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and his Collegues, have been at that time? they who ſpeak ſo much to us of the centre of the Unity of the Miniſtry, inſtead of one only centre to have had two. Confeſs, my dear Brethren, that this Unity of Miniſtry is a fooliſh dream in it ſelf, yea vain in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who find it no more there than elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The Church, as all Societies in the World, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſuffers a thouſand changes in its form. We may not imagine that the Miniſtry of the firſt Ages of the Church was conſtituted as that of this Age. The Biſhops were neither Worldlings, nor great Lords, nor Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49990:147"/>nor Tyrants in the Church. They were the firſt Presbyters, and the perpetual Preſidents of the Elders, or Presbyteries who were of the ſame Order with themſelves. 'Tis the Pride and Vanity of Man which hath made this diſtinction between the Biſhop and the Presbyter. 'Tis the myſtery of Iniquity which began to work even in the times of the Apoſtles. The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were then ſo little diſtinguiſhed from the Biſhops, that even the Clergy were not eſſentially diſtinguiſhed from the People. Remember, my Brethren, that which you have read in the eighth Paſtoral Letter, that in the time of <hi>Tertullian</hi> all the <hi>Laicks</hi> were accounted Presbyters, and that it was permitted even to them, to celebrate the Euchariſt in private, and in their Families. So that this Unity of the Miniſtry could not depend upon I know not what external form: for this external form hath changed perpetually, until at length it degenerated into this Antichriſtian Power which is ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy. This Unity is no more in Succeſſion. For we cannot find a Church which hath not ſuffered Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in its Miniſtry, either by the Violences of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or by the intruſion of falſe Paſtors, or by the Crimes and Vices of wicked Biſhops. If Mr. <hi>Boſſuet</hi> were obliged to prove the Unity of his Miniſtry without interruption from Mr. St. <hi>Faron</hi> to himſelf, he would, it may be, have ſomething of trouble therein. In what then conſiſts the Unity of the Miniſtry? In the Unity of Doctrine and Religion. If the <hi>Bonzes</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>Brachmans</hi> of <hi>India</hi> did preach the ſame crucified Jeſus with my ſelf, and the ſame Chriſtianity, pure and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption, they would have the ſame Miniſtry with me. It would ſignifie very little, with me, from whence they derived their Succeſſion, whether from St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle, or from another <hi>Thomas,</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. God has not tied Salvation to ſuch and ſuch hands, nor hath he obliged us to a neceſſity of receiving the Goſpel from ſome certain men rather than from others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:49990:147"/>
But enough concerning this <hi>Article</hi> of the Unity of the Miniſtry, becauſe 'tis a matter which muſt be handled again, when we come to diſſipate the cheats and juggles by which your Converters endeavour to perplex you, about the Character and Miſſion of thoſe from whom we have received the Reformation.</p>
               <p>If we would ſee a lamentable Deſolation, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Province of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Perſons worthy to be believed lately arrived from thence, do repreſent unto us this Deſolation as one of the moſt hideous and frightful Objects which ought to have place in the Hiſtories of theſe days. It can never be well underſtood how the fury of falſe zeal ſhould tranſport the Court to make a horrible Deſart of one of the moſt lovely Territories of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cevennes</hi> and lower <hi>Languedoc</hi> are cover'd with Troops which find means to live where <hi>Turks</hi> would have died of Famine more than ſix months ſince, after the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Extortions, and Waſtes that have been made there, that is to ſay, after theſe miſerable People had ſuffered thoſe Oppreſſions which had drawn from them that little Blood that did remain; ſo that Paleneſs, Fear, and Death may be ſeen written and engraven upon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances. There are Villages and Towns wholly depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate. The Inhabitants that could not flee are guarded by Dragoons, which carry them to Maſs with Muskets and Swords in their hands; and who at their coming out of the Church put them into Files, that they may number them, and ſee whether any be wanting yea or no. There are a great number that lye in Woods, which have no other places of Refuge but Rocks, no other Houſes but Caves, neither Nouriſhment, but Roots of the Field, becauſe whereof, they do better reſemble Carkaſſes than Men. The City of <hi>Niſmes</hi> have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of new Severities; They have baniſhed to the Iſlands, and I know not whither beyond the Seas, four hundred of its Inhabitants; and they have hanged ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49990:148"/>and ſent Priſoners the Heads of the chief Families; <hi>M. Baudan la Caſſaigne,</hi> and others, all eminent Perſons, to <hi>Carcaſſoon</hi> and <hi>Pierre An Ciſe.</hi> Who can doubt but this is a juſt Caſtigation of that unworthy Action which the Country ſuffered to be extorted from them? <hi>France</hi> did oblige a great number of men to give under their own hand, that from henceforward they would do all the duty of good <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> that they would be found no more at Conventicles; that they would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Relations and Friends; that they would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; and that if they failed in any of theſe things, they intreated the King to chaſtiſe them ſeverely for it. Who doubts but ſuch an Action as this is capable of bringing down the moſt terrible Judgments of God? 'Tis Violence, you will ſay, that hath extorted it from them. I doubt it not at all; but as men have Honor and Conſcience, ſo they have alſo Lives to give, rather than conſent to ſuch baſe and abject Actions, unworthy Men of Honor as well as Chriſtians: but it will be ſaid, that theſe Perſons of Quality upon whom the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fell, did not all ſign this horrible Obligation. This may be; but nevertheleſs, they have been juſtly puniſhed for not maintaining the Courage of their Brethren to aſſemble and pray to God. We know that they were not Perſons of Quality that made up theſe Aſſemblies: but God hath chaſtiſed them in cauſing the puniſhment to fall upon them as well as on thoſe which were found there. They could have been in no other condition if they had done their duty: moreover, they are culpable in that they did not oppoſe the Cowardiſe of their Country-men, which have ſigned a Contract to renounce all their Duties, and have deſired a ſevere Caſtigation in caſe they ſhould ſerve God according to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. An Action done by ſome Perſons, and tolerated by the ſilence of others, cauſes the Thunder of God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to fall upon the whole body. To conclude, all the face of this Territory is hideous and frightful. There
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49990:148"/>are nothing but Solitudes cauſed by the diſperſion of the Inhabitants, of Soldiers, which outrage the poor people which are reduced even to the point of Death by reaſon of Famine, Cold, and other miſeries. There are others which periſh in Priſons, particularly in that fatal Tower of <hi>Aygue-Mortes,</hi> called the Tower of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where the evil Air of the Place, Want, Miſery, and the Stinks of the Priſon kill a vaſt number of theſe miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which go out from thence drag'd at the Tail of a Horſe till they come to the Dunghil. On the other ſide we ſee in this Country a confuſed mixture, which alſo may be called frightful, a mixture I ſay of Courage and Weakneſs, of Lapſes and Recoveries, of Sin and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Being conſtrained by the Violence of the Dragoons, they go to Maſs, or ſuffer themſelves to be dragged thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: on the day after they are found at a private Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to make their Prayers and Applications to God. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were they if their Conduct being always equal and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways alike to it ſelf, had made them Martyrs without ſpot and without offence. Amongſt all this confuſion of Light and Darkneſs, there are nevertheleſs found ſome lovely places: and from many hands the Courage of a Woman is brought to our Knowledge, of which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt; She was one of thoſe condemned to death for having been at a private Aſſembly. At the foot of the Gibbet ſhe cauſed her Child which ſhe ſuckled to be brought unto her, and once more gave it the Breaſt; The Hang-man ſaid unto her, Unhappy Woman, what Milk do you give your Infant in theſe horrors of Death in which you are? Is not the Milk become poiſon? To which ſhe anſwered, If Death had been a horror to me, I had not been now here. This is an Example in which there is ſomething of Prodigy or Miracle, in a Perſon of that Sex, and in that Condition.</p>
               <p>If you will have another ſad Relation, I will give you that of the Perſecution of our Brethren in the Valleys; a Perſecution more cruel than the paſt Ages have ever
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49990:149"/>ſeen. Theſe poor People taken in one day, as in a Net, were waſted and conſumed in the cruel Priſons of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by the moſt inhuman Treatment that ever was. The Duke's People did induſtriouſly publiſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, that they were treated very well, and Letters to that purpoſe were ſent to us out of <hi>Switzerland:</hi> but this Treatment was ſuch, that at <hi>Turene</hi> and <hi>Verſelles,</hi> of more than a thouſand Priſoners there are not above ſixty or eighty ſent to <hi>Geneva;</hi> of whom we will give you the Hiſtory in an Extract of a Letter from <hi>Geneva,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a more ample Relation thereof hereafter.</p>

                     <head>An Extract of a LETTER from <hi>Geneva</hi> bearing Date <hi>January</hi> 24. 1687.</head>
                     <p>BEhold, at length thoſe brave and generous Men, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, arrived here; but they are but a ſmall remnant of a great number who have all died Martyrs under long and grievous Sufferings. We have as yet received but the firſt Squadron, made up of <hi>70</hi> perſons, of all Sexes and Ages, who came hither about two days ſince, in a Seaſon ſo cold, that the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> was frozen to the bottom. Theſe <hi>70</hi> perſons are the Remains of more than a thouſand, who had been kept in two differing Priſons. And theſe <hi>70</hi> came not at us till after they had left twenty of their number on the way, who died of Cold, Famine, and other Miſeries, and with this cruel circumſtance, that their Conductors would not ſuffer any others to remain behind, to aſſiſt their poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren dying and expiring, ſome here, ſome there, in the Snow and Ice, as if they had been dogs. It may be there was a Father which left his Child, a Mother her Daughter, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren their Parents, they with the reſt following their pitileſs Guides with bitter and piercing grief, as well through fear of blows, as through the rigor of the ſeaſon, which was ſuch, as ſeem'd to extinguiſh all other Sentiments in theſe poor men,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49990:149"/>but that of their own proper Miſery. Shall I tell you in what eſtate we have ſeen them arrive with us? All rent and torn, benumm'd, and almoſt dead with Cold and other miſeries, and thoſe which could not go, laid like Calves on Horſes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, they were no ſooner arrived within our Gates, but they fainted through weakneſs and miſery, mingling their tears with them of their brave Brethren, which had made ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Capitulation for themſelves in their Mountains; for to the Glory of <hi>Geneva</hi> be it ſaid, all are yet here. But what grief did betide both the one and the other, when examining and endeavouring to count each other, one was found to have loſt his Father and his Mother, another her Husband or his Wife, another his Children, not knowing as yet who they might find in the reſidue which were to come of thoſe that were moſt dear unto them, and what to expect from the Remains of more than fifteen thouſand Perſons, who are reduced to two; for it is not believed that there are more left. (And 'tis a thing wonderful, that of thirteen or fifteen thouſand Perſons there are not ten which have renounced their Religion, if you except young Boys and Girls which were taken from their Parents in their Priſons, to be diſperſed here and there.) This is that which makes the grief of all theſe poor men, the true Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Truth of Chriſt, the more ſharp and bitter. Their Hiſtory, whether with reſpect to their Calamities or their Piety, will be believed with difficulty in the Ages to come, as well as the Cruelty of their Prince.</p>

            <p>IN our preceding Letter we began the Hiſtory of the Novelties which appeared in Chriſtianity during the Fourth and Fifth Ages, and the firſt which we found there, was the Original of the Monaſtick Life: The Second thing conſiderable (to the Original whereof we ought to give attention) in the Fourth and Fifth Ages, are the Councils called <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> Not as to the Original of a thing evil in it ſelf, but as to a thing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49990:150"/>of which ill uſe hath been made, and of which they make a ſnare at this day for ignorant and feeble Minds. The pretended Infallibility of the Church is the great Illuſion by which they endeavour to deceive the new Converts. They know not where to fix this Infallibility, ſometimes they fix it in the Pope, and ſometimes in a Council: But the <hi>French</hi> Church, by the Authority of the King, hath declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf boldly, a little while ſince, for the Infallibility of Councils againſt the Infallibility of the Pope; for which reaſon 'tis expedient, that you here learn in a few words, the Hiſtory of the Birth of General Councils, that you may underſtand the abſurdity of the Principle upon which your Converters build.</p>
            <p>You muſt therefore know, my Brethren, that the <hi>French</hi> Church not knowing aſſuredly where to place the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Church, diſtinguiſheth Councils into <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, Provincial, National, Oecumenick,</hi> or <hi>General. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan</hi> Councils are thoſe which the Biſhop aſſembles, where he reads his Ordinances to his Curates. <hi>Provincial</hi> Councils are Aſſemblies of the Suffragan Biſhops of one and the ſame Metropolitan. <hi>National</hi> Councils are thoſe where the Biſhops of one or more Nations are Aſſembled. They have not been ſo bold as to aſcribe Infallibility to any one of theſe Aſſemblies; but there are Councils of an higher Order, which it pleaſes theſe Gentlemen to call <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> or <hi>General Councils,</hi> to which they aſcribe Infallibility; <hi>they are,</hi> ſay they, <hi>thoſe in which the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is aſſembled.</hi> When we ask them, where is the Inſtitution of theſe Aſſemblies in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? they cannot find the leaſt foot-ſteps thereof: I ſay the leaſt; 'tis true, they there find Aſſemblies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, of Paſtors and Elders, who conſidered Matters that were diſputed. We ſee one among others in the 15th Chapter of the Acts: Some of the Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren which were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> aſſembled to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe about means to determin the Controverſie, which the Phariſees had raiſed in the Church concerning the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49990:151"/>of obſerving the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> But it would be ridiculous to call a very ſmall Aſſembly and very private, a <hi>General Council,</hi> where there appeared but three Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of thirteen, and only the Clergy which happened to be then at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> When we continue to ask theſe Gentlemen, where we muſt then take the Original of <hi>Oecumenical Councils,</hi> they anſwer us, in the Fourth and Fifth Ages of the Church; and indeed they have reaſon for it. The Firſt of thoſe Councils which bears this Name, is that of <hi>Nice,</hi> aſſembled by the Authority of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in the year 325, to determine the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of the Divinity of the Son againſt <hi>Arrius.</hi> The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was aſſembled by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Elder, in the year 381, to determine againſt <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denied the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Holy Spirit. The Third was called together at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> under the Empire of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Younger, in the year 431, againſt <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who affirmed two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Jeſus Chriſt. The Fourth was aſſembled in the year 451, by the Authority of the Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> who confounded the two Natures. Behold four in 125 years or little more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Men knew not what a <hi>General Council</hi> meant. Now I intreat you, my Brethren, give attention to ſix or ſeven ſhort Reflections which I ſhall make thereon, that you may underſtand the great abſurdity of affixing Infallibility to theſe kind of Aſſemblies; this is at this time of the greateſt importance to you. You muſt throw to the ground this <hi>Phantome</hi> of Infallibility, which ſerves as a ſupport to all the Errors of Popery: Now this <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> knows not where to fix its foot, and when you ſhall have forced it out of this laſt Entrenchment where your Converters have placed it, you will ſee it vaniſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make reflection upon the ſilence of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture concerning it, and ſee if there be any probability, that the deſign of God was to eſtabliſh a ſeat of Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in certain Aſſemblies, and that he ſhould never ſpeak
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49990:151"/>a word thereof. It muſt be granted, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World more important in Religion than this. It is not enough that the Scripture hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Infallibility of the Church in general, as they pretend; for it would be in vain for God to ſay, the Church is Infallible, if we know not what this Church is, where the ſeat of this Infallibility is placed; and by what Mouth ſhe ought to give her Oracles. 'Tis true, they ſend you to Tradition, for all that, whereof the Scripture ſays nothing. But this cannot be a Point for which we are to be ſent to Tradition, for this is the Foundation of Tradition it ſelf: Tradition is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Ancients, and this conſent is found in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: All the Authority of Tradition is nothing, at leaſt before the Infallibility of Councils is eſtabliſhed. The Infallibility of Tradition is not in the teſtimony of ſingle Perſons, of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Chryſoſtom, &amp;c.</hi> for theſe ſingle Perſons were not infallible; and as yet it has not been thought adviſable to make them ſo. 'Tis therefore the Infallibility of Councils which alone can make Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certain: Now Tradition is the ſecond Rule of Faith, equal in Authority to the Holy Scripture; 'tis therefore neceſſary at leaſt, that the Scripture hath given creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Letters to theſe Oecumenical Councils, that their Authority, and that of Tradition may be confeſſed and acknowledged: This is not, ſay I, an Affair for which we are to be ſent to Tradition, as well becauſe it is the moſt important Point of Chriſtianity, on which the Faith of the reſt depends, as becauſe this were to ſend to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to prove the Authority of Tradition it ſelf, which is abſurd; it is not abſurd in the Scripture to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Scripture it ſelf, to prove the Authority of the Scripture, becauſe it is the higheſt Principle, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing beyond it, it muſt be that it prove it ſelf. But the Scripture is above Councils and Tradition, and by conſequence it is neceſſary, that the Scriptures eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Authority both of Tradition and Councils.</p>

2. I intreat you to obſerve, that the Church conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued three Hundred years without having one word of General Councils, ſhe paſſed without them during all that time: Nevertheleſs, ſhe had never more need of them, ſuppoſing them to be infallible means of ending Controverſies and ſuppreſſing Hereſies. For in the firſt three Hundred years the Church was plagued with near Fifty differing Hereſies. Now judg you, whether it be likely, that God ſhould appoint an infallible Judg to his Church, and a ſure way of knowing the Truth, and that he ſhould deny her the uſe of this means for the ſpace of well near two Hundred and fifty years, that is to ſay, from the death of S. <hi>John</hi> the laſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, till the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> So that in the Ages of greateſt purity it will be found, that the Church did not derive this purity from any other Fountain, but from the ſimple and pure word of God; it makes it evident, that the Church may be pure without an infallible Judg in the midſt of her. Now if the Church may continue pure for the ſpace of two Hundred and twenty five years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a General Council, that is to ſay, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Judg, why may ſhe not continue pure three, four, or five Hundred years? For my part, I call this a Demonſtration, that the Church may very well make a ſhift without thoſe Judges that are called <hi>Infallible.</hi> Let them anſwer it when they pleaſe. Obſerve alſo, that the Church was tormented with Fifty horrible He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which thought to have overwhelmed and ſunk her, and having no Councils, ſhe was then left to a Spirit of Error, in thoſe times that ſhe had greateſt need of a Guide, for ſhe had no other Rule but the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles, which according to our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are Medals with two Faces, which may be looked on in a various manner, and which all men expound in favour of their own Perſwaſions. It is not amiſs to bring hither <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Book of Preſcriptions, of which they make uſe, with ſuch ſucceſs to deceive thoſe that
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49990:152"/>are <hi>weak</hi> among us. It appears by this Book, that the Orthodox were in the greateſt diſtreſs in the World, to convince and ſtop the mouths of Hereticks. The Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks gave themſelves to expound the Scripture after their own manner, and in a ſenſe contrary to the truth. <hi>Tertullian</hi> complains thereof, and ſays, <hi>That falſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations do as much injury to Truth, as the boldneſs of thoſe that corrupt the Scriptures.</hi> He adds, <hi>That the weak find themſelves confounded, ſeeing Hereticks, as well as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, diſpute from the Scripture.</hi> To get out of this perplexity, he recurs to the Succeſſion of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> by whom it might be proved, that they taught nothing but what the Apoſtles had taught before them, he found no other way of eſcape; this man had a Mind very much ſtraitned, or he was very ignorant. Why did he not think of General Councils, who are the only infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of knowing the ſenſe of the Scriptures? Neither he, nor any of the Writers of this Age, and of that which followed it, had any knowledg of them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as it is ſaid, it was a means eſtabliſhed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God; and yet for the ſpace of two Hundred years, it muſt be acknowledged, that God hid this means from the whole Church, and that he left her in a ſtreight given up to the Humors of Hereticks, and to their lewd and falſe Interpretations. No reaſonable Man will ever ſwallow ſuch a Prodigy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I intreat you, my Brethren, to conſider if it be likely, that God ſhould place Infallibility in Aſſemblies, whoſe Original was wholly caſual and accidental. The occaſion which gave birth to General Councils, was the Converſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors to Chriſtianity, and the great extent of that Empire: For if the Emperors had continued Pagans, Councils from all parts of the Empire had never been aſſembled; the Emperors would have looked upon it as a Conſpiracy, and would never have permitted it. Beſides, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors by becoming Chriſtians, had loſt half the Provinces of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49990:153"/>Empire, there had never been any General Councils nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the divers Princes which had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Provinces of the Empire, would not have permitted their Subjects to aſſemble with thoſe, who continued under the Rule of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for fear leſt theſe Conferences ſhould be deſigned, to ſearch out ways of returning under the Government of their firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Now judg, if a Tribunal, which in the purpoſe of God, was to be the Fountain of the Oracles of the Church in all Ages, ought to owe its birth to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Affairs, and Mundane Circumſtances, that were wholly and purely ſo. Ought not God to have eſtabliſhed this Tribunal without dependance on the World and the Affairs thereof, as from the beginning he eſtabliſhed <hi>Presbyteries</hi> (ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Aſſemblies of <hi>Paſtors</hi>) is every City, and in every particular Church? He muſt have a very obdurate Mind, I think, who is not moved and touched with this Diſcourſe and Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What may be the aſſurance that a Man may have of ſuch an Article of Faith which is founded on a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact notoriouſly falſe. 'Tis that the Councils of the Fourth and Fifth Ages were aſſembled from the whole Univerſal Church. That, ſay I, is notoriouſly falſe; there were not above three Hundred and eighteen Fathers in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the moſt ancient and the moſt venerable of all the Councils. What are three Hundred and eighteen Biſhops for the whole vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where there was an infinite number of them? It does not appear that all the Churches did depute their Biſhops thither, nor that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire did aſſemble to chooſe ſome one out of their Body, who ſhould carry their Counſel and Advice. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> called together all the Biſhops in general, thoſe that could, and thoſe that would, appeared there; none appeared there, but thoſe of the Eaſtern Church, there were not Twelve of the Latin Church there; out of all <hi>Spain,</hi> none were ſeen but <hi>Hoſius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49990:153"/>of <hi>Corduba;</hi> out of all <hi>France,</hi> none but <hi>Nicaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Die,</hi> or <hi>Dijon.</hi> Beſides this, there were Churches out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; it may be there were Churches even in the <hi>Indies,</hi> at leaſt, thoſe which tell us, that S. <hi>Thomas</hi> carried the Goſpel thither, ought to believe ſo. 'Tis certain at leaſt, that there were large Churches in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ſpeaks of a great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution which was raiſed at that time againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches of <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the Impudence or ill guided Zeal of <hi>Maruthas</hi> a Biſhop, who burnt one of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which the Perſians had conſecrated to the Honor of the Fire. Theſe Churches of <hi>Perſia</hi> were not called to this Council, nor did they appear there. All the World are at an Agreement, that the firſt Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> held under <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, was not General: There were none but Eaſtern Biſhops there; yea, two Hundred years after, in the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Weſtern Church did not as yet receive the Canons thereof: So that frankly and openly, 'tis to ſcoff Men to call them General Councils in the ſenſe which is given to the Word at this day. 'Tis true, that theſe firſt Councils called themſelves ſo, but why, and in what ſenſe? It was according to the Stile which was then in uſe. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was then called <hi>Orbis,</hi> the World Univerſal, the Greeks called it <hi>Oikoumene</hi> the habitable part of the Earth, the Emperors thereof were called the Univerſal Emperors; the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Emperors occaſioned this; the great ones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways blow up their Titles. The extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was great indeed, but as if they had been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the whole Earth, they cauſed themſelves to be called Maſters of the World Univerſal. A General Council in this ſenſe ſignifies no more than a Council aſſembled from all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I intreat you to give attention to that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, according to theſe Gentlemen, to make a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>Oecumenical.</hi> Is it neceſſary that there be Biſhops from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49990:154"/>all parts of the Church? by no means; for then the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were not <hi>Oecumenick.</hi> The Pope was not there, either by himſelf, or his Legates; and it is not known that there was any of the Weſtern Biſhops there. Nevertheleſs, 'tis <hi>Oecumenick;</hi> but why? becauſe that all the Church conſented to it at laſt: for its Canons were not received at <hi>Rome</hi> more than two hundred years after. The Church Univerſal, ſay I, hath approved it, not by Subſcriptions and a formal Conſent, but by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which they call tacit and implicite: and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Opinion of the Doctors of <hi>France,</hi> That to make a Council <hi>Oecumenick,</hi> 'tis enough that it be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward approved. That is the reaſon why the Canons of the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which is generally believed to have been an <hi>Arrian</hi> Council, are at this day ſeen in the Code of the Univerſal Church. That is the reaſon why many men are willing the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> ſhould be <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical.</hi> 'Tis becauſe though there were none but <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops there, yet the moſt part of the Biſhops of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſubſcribed it afterwards. Now I intreat you obſerve the Abſurdity which I am about to make you ſenſible of. Behold a Council, for example, the firſt <hi>Oecumenical</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which in its form is but a particular Council, and by conſequence cannot be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; nevertheleſs, becauſe God foreſaw that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would be approved by all the Church, he preſides there by a Spirit of Infallibility againſt all the Rules which he hath eſtabliſh'd for his own Conduct with reſpect to Councils. So that when God foreſees that a Council which is particular in its Compoſition, will one day be accounted Oecumenical, becauſe of a conſent that will be given to it either by Subſcriptions ſent and ſeparately made, or by a tacit conſent, he there pours out a Spirit of Infallibility. But if he foreſees that this Synod will be neglected, as a particular Synod, he lets it paſs for as much as 'tis worth, and doth not make it Infallible. Is not this to play with the Spirit of God, and the Reaſon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49990:154"/>of Men? Who ſees not by this example, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of an <hi>Oecumenical Council</hi> doth in no wiſe depend upon a Spirit of Infallibility which preſides there, but on the conſent of men, which perſuade themſelves, right or wrong, that ſuch an Aſſembly hath happily hit on the truth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I pray judge whether it be probable that theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, called <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> were infallible Judges of Controverſies, without knowing it. At this day, when the Pope aſſembles an <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> this Council believes it ſelf to be Infallible, it acts and ſpeaks as ſuch. Let them demonſtrate to us this Character in the firſt Councils; let them ſhew us, that they acted as infallible, and that they ſpoke as ſuch. If I ſhould make a Book, whereas I am only making a Letter, I could ſhew you a hundred circumſtances of theſe ancient Councils, which will make it evident, that this Dream never crept into the minds of any of the Members of thoſe Aſſemblies, that they were there as Infallible Judges. But in this caſe, 'tis not we that are obliged to prove, 'tis the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, for they are thoſe which do affirm. Preſs them, ſay I, about it, and ask them their Proofs, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Councils believed themſelves Infallible. Go farther, and ask them, Whether it be poſſible that theſe Councils ſhould be Infallible, and that not one of the Divines of thoſe Ages ſhould doubt of it; and that in their Diſputes with Hereticks they ſhould make no uſe of this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> and St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> had great Diſputes againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but they never thought fit to oppoſe unto them the Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as Infallible. Where were their Wits? Why did they not tell them, God hath promiſed, <hi>That when two or three are gathered together in his name he will be in the midſt of them?</hi> 'Tis a Promiſe of Infallibility, belonging to General Councils. The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> was aſſembled in the Name of God, held in all its forms, and aſſembled from the whole Church:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49990:155"/>it is therefore Infallible, and by conſequence you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate not to ſubmit unto it. Thus they reaſon againſt us, and 'tis thus that men ought to reaſon naturally when they are of the Opinion and Principles of Popery. We do not ſee one word of this in the Authors of the fourth and fifth Ages. On the contrary, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> Let us lay by the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> on my part, and the Council of <hi>Ariminum</hi> on your part, and let us diſpute from the Scripture,<note n="*" place="margin">Cont. Maxim. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> confeſſing, the one and the other of theſe Aſſemblies might err, although it be very certain that the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> did not actually do ſo. 'Tis as if I ſhould ſay to a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> Let us lay by my H. Scripture and your Alcoran, as ſuppoſing it poſſible that both the one and other of them may be falſe. It muſt be granted, that I were wicked, or a fool, to ſpeak thus, if it were not upon thoſe Suppoſitions which are called falſe, and whereof we ſometimes ſerve our ſelves to draw an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to an abſurdity. Behold then a Prodigy which paſſes all imagination; the Chriſtians had among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves infallible Judges, and knew nothing of it: but behold much more, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> not only knew not, that he had right to oppoſe the Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> as Infallible, to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> but he even confeſſes to the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that no Authority of Council was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and without Appeal. The <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> to prove to him that the Baptiſm of Hereticks was worth nothing, brought him the Teſtimony of St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> He anſwers, without ceremony, That he acknowledged no Teſtimony ſure and certain but that of the Canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament; that as to the deciſions of Biſhops, thoſe which came after, and above all Councils, might very well correct them. After which he adds,<note n="*" place="margin">De Bapt. cont. Donat. <hi>lib. 2. cap. 3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>And even the Councils which are held in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in every Province, do without difficulty give place to full Councils, which are aſſembled from all the Chriſtian World; and theſe full
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49990:155"/>Councils,</hi> (ſo he calls Oecumenical Councils) <hi>may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by thoſe which follow; when that which was hid is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and by ſome experience men come to know what they were ignorant in.</hi> Obſerve, that the thing under debate was not a matter of Diſcipline only, as they will tell you, but to know whether the Baptiſm of Hereticks were of any value. 'Twas a Point of Doctrine, if there were ever and ſuch.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To conclude, I conjure you, my Brethren, give yet attention to this, 'tis, that although the Dream of your Converters ſhould have ſome foundation, and that the Church Univerſal aſſembled in a Body by its Guides were Infallible, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have no part in this Privilege, nor would it extend it ſelf to the Councils ſince <hi>Berengarius,</hi> which they deſire you ſhould look upon as the Rules of your Faith. For theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were never Aſſemblies of the Church Univerſal ſince the Schiſm of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> they are at moſt but Councils of the Latin Church: but the Latin Church, ſay they, is become the Univerſal and Catholick Church, excluding all other Chriſtian Communions which are ſeparate from her; and by conſequence, her Councils are thoſe of the Church Univerſal. This is the moſt fooliſh of all Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould be the only Church, excluding all the Communions of <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> We have ſhewn the extravagance of this Pretence in our former Letters, for which reaſon, at preſent we may well ſuppoſe it as indiſputable, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for 800 years paſt, hath had no Oecumenical Councils in the ſenſe that ſhe her ſelf underſtands the Word; from whence you may conclude, that ſhe hath had no Infallible Councils.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, 'tis neceſſary to oblige you to give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to this Original of Oecumenical Councils in the fourth and fifth Ages; becauſe, without doubt, it was one of the means which the Devil made uſe of to eſtabliſh the Empire and Domination of Antichriſt. Not that the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49990:156"/>firſt Councils called Oecumenical were not aſſembled with good intention, and were not very uſeful at that ſeaſon, and in that time. But it happens to this good thing as to the moſt part of others which have been introduced with a good intention, the Devil hath taken occaſion from thence to bring in either Opinions or Practices which have deſtroyed the Church. Martyrdom is an excellent work; yet from thence men have taken occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Opinion of Merits, and Works of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Reſpect for the Martyrs is very juſt, and very reaſonable; yet that hath made way for Indulgences, the Invocation of Saints, Adoration of Relicks and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The uſe of Oecumenical Councils hath been found good upon ſeveral occaſions. The Biſhops coming from all Parts have appeared not as Judges, but as Witneſſes of the Faith of their Churches, and this unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Faith hath produced a very good effect for the eſtabliſhing of Points fundamental. But the Spirit of Lies hath nevertheleſs made uſe thereof afterwards, as a means to build that Univerſal Empire over the Church; an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire which is one of the characters of Antichriſt. At the beginning it was the Emperors which aſſembled theſe Councils. Theſe Aſſemblies were made by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were of the number of thoſe called to them: he muſt have renounced all Sincerity that doth not agree unto it, after he hath read <hi>Euſebius, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Zozomon,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret.</hi> When the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was ruined in the Weſt, the Emperors having no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and longer to call Aſſemblies of the whole Church, becauſe they were no longer Maſters of it; the Popes, who advanced according to the meaſure that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors declined, were willing to lay hold of this Right. They endeavoured to re-unite, under their Authority, all the Provinces which had formerly been united under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; in which they were ſucceſsful, and thereby form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecond <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which is the Empire of the Boaſt and of Antichriſt. Theſe Oecumenical Aſſemblies
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49990:156"/>were of great uſe to them in this; at the head of which Aſſemblies they placed themſelves in the quality of the firſt Patriarchs. The cuſtom which the Councils took in the Fourth Age, of adding Anathema's to their Deciſions, did alſo ſerve them afterwards to poſſeſs men with a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of their Infallibility. I have not been able to find that Councils did anathematize any one before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice.</hi> We have the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> reckoned for the third in the Collection of Father <hi>Labbeus</hi> held un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the year 258. <hi>Zonarus</hi> holds it for the moſt ancient of all the Councils, he means, whoſe Deciſions we have. It ſeems to me, we have therein the form of the ancient Councils. Every one there ſpeaks his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on modeſtly; that which had the plurality of Voices paſſed, but they there made no Decrees nor Anathema's.</p>
            <p>We do not ſee that in the firſt two Ages, they held Councils for the deciding matters of Faith and Doctrine. There was one held about the Controverſie concerning <hi>Eaſter,</hi> that is to ſay, Whether they ought to celebrate the Fourteenth of the Month of <hi>March?</hi> but this was a Point of Diſcipline. There was in thoſe times an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Hereticks, as appears by the Book of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus;</hi> but I have not obſerved that they did aſſemble Councils againſt them before the third Age: nevertheleſs, if they had look'd upon Councils as Infallible, it would have been neceſſary to prevent Seduction, and to ſecure the Faith of Chriſtians.</p>

               <head>An Article of Controverſie. The true Idea of Schiſm. That thoſe which are called Schiſmaticks are not out of the Church.</head>
               <p>AFter having ſpoken of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and confuted the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm which they draw from this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Letters; we muſt anſwer the Sophiſm, which is drawn from the Schiſm which ruines this Unity. 'Tis a Point
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49990:157"/>which your Converters do continually repeat, and beat upon you. Schiſm, ſay they, is a hideous crime: Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks are out of the Church; there is no Salvation for them: and although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, you ought not to break with her. Their modern Writers which ſeem willing to ſoften the Maxims of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do nevertheleſs obſerve no meaſure on this Subject, and on this Point. They proceed ſo far as to maintain, That although it ſhould be true that even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be fallen into Idolatry, we ought not to forſake her, and could not juſtly ſet up Altar againſt Altar. We muſt return to theſe Gentlemen, not Paradox for Paradox, but Truth for Lies: but a Truth which is oppoſite to their Falſhood, as our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes are oppoſite to us. They ſay, that though even the Church ſhould fall into Idolatry, we cannot be ſaved if we ſeparate from it. And I ſay, although even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have Reaſon at the bottom, and were not Idolatrous, and that we were out in our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, we ſhould not hazard our Salvation by continuing as we are. Men are every where well where they have Chriſtianity and the marrow and ſubſtance of it; and 'tis a folly to imagine that the Salvation of men depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the humor of their Guides. It may be therefore that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> were miſtaken, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not great enough to oblige the Faithful to go out of her: let us ſuppoſe, they had done better to leave things as they were, I do nevertheleſs maintain, that at this day you do not in any wiſe hazard your Salvation by continuing where they have placed you; becauſe however it be, you have Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in its integrity, you have it wholly pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt. In every Society where that is found, a man may be ſaved, after whatſoever manner it be formed. The Idea which men have formed of Schiſm for many Ages paſt is the moſt falſe that can be imagined: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the falſhood of it, 'tis the moſt dangerous and cruel
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49990:157"/>Chimera that could be found. Every Society would be Catholick Church to the excluſion of all others. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends thus far for her ſelf. The Greek Church makes no leſs pretence thereto. He that goes out of this Church breaks the Unity, and he that breaks it is no longer in the Church. Now he who is no longer in the Church, is no longer in a ſtate and way of Salvation, whatever he ſay and whatever he do. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what they ſay; behold the Chimera.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore rectifie this Idea of Schiſm, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Unity which we have given you. The Unity of the Univerſal Church does not ſubſiſt within the bounds of one certain Communion, nor in adherence to certain Paſtors, to the excluſion of all others: but in the Unity of <hi>Spirit, Doctrine, Sacraments,</hi> and Evangelical <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in general, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Paſtors declaring the Truth of the Goſpel. What muſt be done then to make a Schiſm with reſpect to the Church Univerſal? He muſt renounce the Chriſtian Doctrine, the Sacraments of the Church, and the Goſpel Miniſtry; that is to ſay, He muſt be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or an Heretick. But every Society that goes out of another and greater Society of which it was a part, makes no Schiſm with reſpect to the Church Univerſal, whilſt it retains the Doctrine, the Sacraments, and the Miniſtry of the Goſpel: it goes not out of the Church becauſe it carries the Church with it, and it carries the Church with it, becauſe it carries Chriſtianity with it. It carries, ſay I, the Church with it, in ſuch a manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that it leaves it in the Society which it leaves; for leaving true Chriſtianity there, it leaves the true Church there alſo. And the advantage of being the Church, and of having Chriſtianity, is a Privilege which may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed intire, and without prejudice to other Chriſtian Societies.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore know, that there is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Schiſm. Particular Schiſm is a Separation from a particular Church: a Univerſal Schiſm is a Separation
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49990:158"/>from the Univerſal Church. Univerſal Schiſm conſiſts in the Renunciation of the Univerſal Church, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing her Doctrine, Sacraments, and Miniſtry. For example, If the one half of Chriſtians ſhould ſeparate from the other, and ſet up a new Goſpel, according to which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be ſet ſide by ſide with Jeſus Chriſt, the legal Ceremonies re-eſtabliſhed, the Evangelical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry ſhould be changed into the Miniſtry of Prieſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of <hi>Aaron;</hi> the Sacraments of the Church ſhould be joyned to the Sacraments of the Old Teſtament; it were certain that this would be a true Schiſm; for theſe Men would renounce the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Goſpel. The <hi>Mahometans,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out renouncing Jeſus Chriſt, and calling him falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, have ſet up a Prophet ſuperior to him, and receive the Impoſtures of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> admit Circumciſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Baptiſm, have made a Religion truly and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally different from that of Chriſt's. 'Tis therefore a true univerſal Schiſm. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who have renounced almoſt all the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, who deſpiſe and neglect the Sacraments by going out of the Church, are become Schiſmaticks, and true Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks with reſpect to the Church Univerſal; for they have not carried the Church with them, becauſe they have not carried Chriſtianity with them. According to this Idea, Univerſal Schiſm, or Schiſm with reſpect to the Univerſal Church, doth not eſſentially differ from Hereſie and Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p>Particular Schiſm is when a Man ſeparates from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, be it for ſome Point of Doctrine, be it for ſome quarrel about Diſcipline, be it for ſome perſonal Differences of the Guides among themſelves. Of this ſort of Schiſms there is an infinite number of Examples. In the Second Age there was a Schiſm between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>Aſia,</hi> about a controverſie of Ceremonies, about the day on which <hi>Eaſter</hi> ought to be obſerved. The Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> maintained, that the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49990:158"/>Chriſtian Paſſover ought to be obſerved on the ſame day that the Jews obſerved theirs; and they ſaid, they held it as a Tradition from St. <hi>John.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on the contrary, ſaid that Chriſtians ought to obſerve <hi>Eaſter</hi> on the Lord's-day following the Jewiſh Paſſover. And for the ſake of this goodly Controverſie, <hi>Victor</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo raſh, as to ſeparate the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> from his Communion. This Schiſm continued not only until the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but a very long time after; for mention is made of the <hi>Quartodecimani</hi> in the General Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in the year 431. So they called thoſe who celebrated <hi>Eaſter</hi> with the Jews, on the 14th day of the Month of <hi>March.</hi> In the Third Age, <hi>Novatian</hi> formed a conſiderable Schiſm, about a Point of Diſcipline; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether we ought to receive thoſe who fell in times of Perſecution to the Peace of the Church. This Schiſm continued a long time. We find this Schiſm continuing amidſt all the great troubles that were betwixt the <hi>Arrians</hi> and the Orthodox; the union of Opinions that was between the <hi>Novatians</hi> and the Catholicks with reſpect to the Doctrine of <hi>Arrius,</hi> did not put a period unto it. In the ſame Age, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> made another Schiſm in <hi>Africa,</hi> about the choice of a Biſhop of <hi>Carthage.</hi> Two Parties being formed about it, a Diviſion was made, it ſpread through all <hi>Africa,</hi> and continued many Ages. There happened another in the beginning of the Fifth Age, by one named <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who taught there were two Perſons, as well as two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt. Another was made a little while after by <hi>Eutyches,</hi> Abbot of a Monaſtery in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who deſiring to oppoſe <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who diſtinguiſhed two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Chriſt Jeſus, confounded the two Natures that he might not ſeparate them; and theſe two Schiſms have continued for 1200 years, and do continue to this day. In the Tenth Age happened the great Schiſm of the Greek Church from the Latin. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf has had an infinite number of Schiſms in her own
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49990:159"/>Bowels, occaſioned by her Anti-Popes, And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt (which may ſerve for a Rule for all) was the great Schiſm of Popes and Anti-Popes, whereof the one ſat at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other at <hi>Avignon.</hi> This Schiſm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Weſt into two different Parties, under two diſtinct Heads. To conclude, in theſe laſt times a great Schiſm is happened in the Latin Church, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three great Bodies, the Papiſts, the Lutherans, and the Reformed. I paſs by an infinite number of little Schiſms, which have been in the Eaſt between Church and Church, and oftentimes among the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Church. Two Biſhops were ſeen for a long time at <hi>Antioch;</hi> the Party of one of them was called <hi>Mileſians,</hi> the other Party <hi>Euſtathians,</hi> this was in the Fourth and Fifth Ages. Theſe are, ſay I, particular Schiſms. And it may be ſaid, that not one of theſe Schiſmatical Parties did ſeparate from the Univerſal Church, becauſe not one of them abandoned Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; they returned and carried it with them.</p>
               <p>Now the Illuſion in this matter comes from hence, that we confound theſe two ſorts of Schiſms, thoſe that are Univerſal with thoſe which are particular, and we aſcribe to particular Schiſms that which belongs only to Schiſm univerſal, <hi>viz.</hi> Excluſion from Salvation. For 'tis true, that he who makes a Schiſm from the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, by renouncing her Doctrine, Sacraments, and Miniſtry, is utterly out of the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any right to eternal Life. But 'tis falſe, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Schiſm either from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or from the Greek Church, or Schiſm of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in it ſelf, doth exclude from Salvation. This folly proceeds from another, and that is, that every particular Church looks on herſelf as the Catholick and Univerſal Church, and her particular Doctrines as the Univerſal and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Doctrines of Chriſtianity: In ſuch manner, that thoſe who ſeparate themſelves from her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her Doctrines, ſhe looks on them, as being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49990:159"/>from the Univerſal Church, and as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Univerſal Doctrine of Chriſtianity. But no Church hath carried this folly to that degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done; for ſhe calls herſelf the Catholick and Univerſal Church, to the excluſion of all others: And ſhe would fain, that the Doctrines which are peculiar to her, as the Supremacy of the Pope, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be accounted the Univerſal Truths of Chriſtanity. Thence it comes to paſs, that ſhe conſiders as Schiſmaticks, and damned all thoſe which ſeparate from her, and renounce the moſt inconſiderable Doctrines which ſhe hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by her Anathema's. To make this fooliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion vaniſh and diſappear, no more is to be done, but to make more evident the true Idea of Schiſm, which the Diſputes of theſe laſt Ages, and the Prejudices of the Ancients, have ſtrangely perplexed and confounded. To this end it will be uſeful to conſider divers of thoſe Schiſms of which we have ſpoken, and ſee what we ought to judge concerning the Salvation of thoſe who lived in them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there have been Schiſms which have been made without any Controverſies about Doctrine or Diſcipline, only upon perſonal Quarrels between Biſhop and Biſhop; ſuch was that furious Schiſm of the Donatiſts in <hi>Africa,</hi> which was made only upon the occaſion of the choice of a Biſhop of <hi>Carthage:</hi> Afterwards the Donatiſts eſpouſed the Opinion of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> about the Nullity of the Baptiſm of Hereticks, and it may be, ſome other Opinions of little importance, that they might the more eaſily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and continue their Schiſm with the Catholicks. But the true foundation of the Schiſm was nothing but a particular Quarrel. The Donatiſts held all the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Catholick Church, they had the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the ſame Diſcipline, and the ſame Miniſtry. This being ſo, he muſt be very cruel that will damn an infinite number of private Perſons, who followed
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49990:160"/>their Guides, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> followed <hi>Abſalom,</hi> in the ſimplicity of their Hearts. I ſay nothing concerning the Authors of the Schiſm, nor of thoſe who did maintain it; as they violated the Laws of Charity, and troubled the Peace of the Church, we leave them to the Judgment of God: We ſay nothing neither of the <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> a ſort of People which aroſe among the Donatiſts, and offered an Hundred Violences to the Orthodox. I ſpeak of thoſe plain People, who in the ſimplicity of their Heart, do without Diſſimulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Creed explicated according to the ſenſe of the Church Univerſal, who believe all the Chriſtian Doctrine, from the firſt Article to the laſt; and beſides, labour with great diligence in the practice of Holineſs and Devotion: to condemn theſe Men, ſay I, only becauſe they do not communicate with the Paſtors of the Catholick Church, is a fooliſh and a barbarous Doctrine, of which I do not think there is a Man in the World throughly perſwaded, although there be a Thouſand and a Thouſand pretend ſo to be.</p>
               <p>There are other Schiſms which were made about Controverſies in Doctrine, ſuch is the Schiſm of the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and that of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> who continue at this day, and comprehend an infinite number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Eaſt. I believe that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> deſigned to reduce the Opinion of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> to another form; which Opinion is that of our Socinians, who make Jeſus Chriſt a mere Man. But we muſt judg o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of their Succeſſors. At this day the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and the <hi>Eutychians</hi> embrace the Apoſtles Creed, and that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as do the Greeks and the Latins, they believe in Jeſus Chriſt the eternal Son of God, God himſelf, dead, and raiſed again for the Salvation of Men; and the Diſputes which they have with the reſt of the Church, are at preſent, nothing but Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about Words and differing manners of expreſſion.
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49990:160"/>To damn theſe Millions of People, becauſe of the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſingle Man, who had the boldneſs a Hundred and twenty years ago, to teach contrary to the manner after which we ought to conceive of the Incarnation of the Word, is a Cruelty founded in a moſt prodigious Error and Miſtake. 'Tis evident, that we ought to range them with the reſt of the Eaſtern Church, which is not much more pure, than that of the Weſt, and to leave their Salvation to the judgment of God, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knows how far his Patience will proceed. Theſe two Schiſms were without doubt criminal in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal: But time hath changed the ſtate of things, and at this day thoſe Chriſtians which are called <hi>Jacobites,</hi> and follow the Schiſm of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> ſuppoſing they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all Chriſtian Truths neceſſary to Salvation, are as well where they are, as if they rejoyned themſelves to the other Chriſtians of the Eaſt, provided they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a Spirit of Charity. If they be ſo raſh as to condemn the reſt, therein they ſin; but the Greeks which condemn them are not leſs guilty than they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they deſcend directly from the Catholick and Orthodox flock, and the others be only a ſeparate branch. And this helps to ſhew you, that although a Schiſm were criminal in its Original, and headily and raſhly made, nevertheleſs it is not always neceſſary under pain of eternal Damnation, to return from whence we came. From whence I confirm the Theſis which I laid down at the beginning of this Queſtion; that the Idea which they make to you about the horror of Schiſm, is a Dream, and that tho it ſhould be true, that our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the beginning of the paſt Age were raſh, the People which followed it in the ſimplicity of their Hearts, would not hazard their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereby, they that made it were to account for it, and at the moſt, thoſe which do maintain it. So my Brethren, you would be in ſafety, and only we in danger. But I very well perceive, that this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49990:161"/>to calm the Perturbations which your Converters, and your own Thoughts may give you about it: For you will ſay, ſuppoſing that our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the laſt Age were unjuſt and raſh; 'tis true, that we who did not make the Schiſm ſhall not ſuffer thereby. Our Fathers when they went out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> carried the Church and Chriſtianity with them, and this Chriſtianity may nouriſh, and ſave us, maugre the Separation. Nevertheleſs on this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, we do no ill, yea we ſhall do well to re-unite our ſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> We ſhall heal a Wound, which being open, renders the Church deformed; Peace is to be preferred before Diviſion: This is without doubt, the deſcendants which acknowledg that their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors did wrongfully ſeparate from a certain ſtock, do well to re-unite themſelves thereto for edification, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were not abſolutely neceſſary to their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore that we may come nearer to the caſe in which you are at preſent with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe a Separation which was made for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſome worth and value, <hi>i. e.</hi> becauſe of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Doctrine and Worſhip. This is the caſe in which you are, and on this ſuppoſition we will ſhew you in what follows, that you cannot return to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>SInce we have been upon the Hiſtory of the fourth and fifth Ages, we have found there two great Novelties, which have had very unhappy effects in the following Ages. They are the Monaſtick Life, and the Councils that are called Oecumenick. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a third of them; 'tis the Original of the Hierarchy, which hath given birth to the Antichriſtian Tyranny. This Word ſignifies <hi>ſacred Rule</hi> or <hi>Government:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:49990:162"/>is underſtood that Subordination of Paſtors, which hath been ſeen in the Church for a 1000 or 1200 years. In this Subordination are ſeen the loweſt Orders in the loweſt Seats; above theſe loweſt Orders are ſeen Prieſts ſubdivided into Curates, Deans, rural Deans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Above the Prieſts are the Grand Vicars, above the Grand Vicars are the Biſhops, above the Biſhops are the Arch-Biſhops or Metropolitans, above the Arch-Biſhops are the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, above the Primates are the Exarchs, above the Exarchs are the Patriarchs, and above all theſe is ſeen a Head, which was framed inſenſibly, and by little and little, and placed there; this is it which is called the Pope. All this is a new Invention with reſpect to the Apoſtles, and this Hierarchy was unknown before the Fourth Age. We have the Happineſs at this day to have the <hi>French</hi> Church, that is to ſay, your Converters, for teſtimonies of this Truth. They do maintain, That the Apoſtles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed no preciſe form of Government, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves to preach the Goſpel, to ſend perſons to do ſo, and to place in every Church a Biſhop to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it. They ſay, that it is not certain that S. <hi>John,</hi> the eldeſt of the Apostles, <hi>i. e.</hi> he which lived longeſt, did give to the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> amongſt whom he died, any form of Government; that it was in the Fourth Age that the Hierarchical form of Government was given to the Church; that therein they followed no divine Right or Inſtitution of the Apoſtles, (who determined nothing concerning it) but the Polick Order and Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. As this Empire was divided into Provinces, Metropolitical Cities, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectures, <hi>i. e.</hi> Governments, ſo they alſo divided the Churches into Metropolitan, Provincial, and National.</p>
            <p>And indeed, from the time of the Apoſtles there was no Principality, nor ſo much as any Primacy in the Church. The Apoſtles, by an Authority which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived immediately from Jeſus Chriſt, governed the Church without Subordination, and without Diviſion.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49990:162"/>The Spirit which guided them being one, and poured out on them all, they were always at agreement it what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Edification of the Churches; but they did not leave any Succeſſor that had the ſame Authority with themſelves. It is not true that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was their Prince, it does not appear that he had any Primacy of Order above the reſt; 'tis true he is often named firſt; but that doth not prove that he was the firſt, or the Preſident of the Apoſtolical College. We ſee that the other Apoſtles treated with him after ſuch a manner, as makes it apparent, that they did not acknowledge in him any kind of Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, which ſhould advance him above them. We ſee that they ſent him to <hi>Samaria;</hi> it would have appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to ſend, and not be ſent, if he had been the Prince of the Apoſtles. We ſee that after he had preached the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and ſome other Pagans, they made great complaints thereon. We ſee that S. <hi>Paul</hi> rebuked him to the face, and even in publick, becauſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Jews he warped, and uſed ſome diſſimulation with reſpect to the uſe of indifferent things forbidden by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Men do not uſe to deal ſo with their Prince. The Succeſſors of the Apoſtles left in all Churches Presbyters or Biſhops to preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments: but in the beginning the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and the Biſhop were not diſtinguiſhed. Thoſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Biſhop in one place, he calls alſo Elders or Presbyters, in the ſame place or in another. 'Tis a matter of Fact which our Adverſaries cannot deny. In the 20th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the Presbyters or Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> calls them Biſhops; and in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> where he ſpeaks ſometimes of a Biſhop, he ſpeaks more frequently of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and by Elders he underſtands the very ſame which he had called Biſhops. In the Cities where the Churches were great, there were many Presbyters; one of them did preſide over the reſt, not by turn, but by a privilege which did always appertain to him. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49990:163"/>this Preſident, <hi>The Elder which rules well is worthy of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honor.</hi> This preſiding Presbyter, in the beginning of the ſecond Age, arrogates to himſelf the name of Biſhop, (which before was common to his Collegues,) ſo that there was no other but the Preſident of the Presbytery who call'd himſelf Biſhop. He attributed to himſelf alſo the right of impoſing hands as well on thoſe which were received as Paſtors, as on the Penitents, and thoſe which were received to the Communion of the Myſteries. In all this there was as yet no Hierarchy, no Dependence, no Appeals, no Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction. Every Biſhop, with his College of Presbyters, was Sovereign in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrict, and in his Church; and this Church was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of any other. You may remember how S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> in our Eleventh Paſtoral Letter hath told us in expreſs words,<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. 74.</note> 
               <hi>Every Biſhop may uſe his Authority in the Government of his Church according to his own Will, being under no obligation to give an account thereof to any but the Lord.</hi> And elſewhere,<note n="†" place="margin">Concil. Carth. Anno 258.</note> 
               <hi>That every Biſhop is Maſter of himſelf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be judged by another Biſhop, as he alſo cannot judge other Biſhops.</hi> All honeſt men are agreed at this day therein. The Divines themſelves of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church maintain it, and at this time they lend us their Studies and Illuminations to refute the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of the Papal Tyranny, who would find in the three firſt Ages of the Church Proofs of the Primacy, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Principality of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the World. The Defenders of this Antichriſtian Power quote to us the Action of <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who about the end of the Second Age excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> becauſe they would not keep <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> preciſely the ſame day that he did: and from thence they conclude, That the Pope was even then the Prince of all Churches. But to this your own Converters do anſwer for us, that in this <hi>Victor</hi> exerciſed no Right but what was common to all Biſhops, and that the Biſhops of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:49990:163"/>
               <hi>Aſia</hi> might exerciſe it on <hi>Victor,</hi> as he had exerciſed it on them; that this Excommunication of <hi>Victor</hi> was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from his Communion; that the Biſhops did communicate one with another by Letters, which they called <hi>Letters of Communion, formed Letters,</hi> &amp;c. When they were angry or diſcontented one with another, they did no longer write theſe Letters of Communion to thoſe of whom they believed the Church had reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and they received no more from them; that this is it which <hi>Victor</hi> then did, and that all Biſhops have Right, by cuſtom, to do the ſame thing. The Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Popes quote to us alſo the Words of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>That it was neceſſary all other Churches ſhould have recourſe to this Church, becauſe it was the principal, and the moſt potent.</hi> But the <hi>French Roman</hi> Catholick Doctors anſwer for us, that the ſenſe is, That the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> becauſe the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Capital City of the Empire, and becauſe of its gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur might be a ſufficient Witneſs of Apoſtolical Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe Chriſtians came thither upon buſineſs from all Parts of the World, and that coming thither they might there be Witneſſes of the Faith of all Churches ſcattered throughout all the Empire: and that ſo the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, made up and formed of all Nations, might be a Witneſs of the Faith of all the Churches in the World. They object to us alſo, That it appears by the Works of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that Biſhops condemned and depoſed in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> had recourſe to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for their re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. But the <hi>French</hi> Doctors anſwer with us, That by the ſame Letters of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> it appears alſo, that theſe Attempts were diſallowed and condemned, and that they gave the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to underſtand, that he had nothing to do to receive the Complaints of any of the Eccleſiaſticks of the <hi>African Church.</hi> So that theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen acknowledge with us, that in the three firſt Ages of Chriſtianity there was no Principality, no ſubordinate
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49990:164"/>Juriſdiction, nor no dependence of one Church upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, not excepting the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. But we do alſo maintain unto them, That from the Third Age, the Churches that had their Seats in thoſe Cities which are called Metropoles, <hi>i. e.</hi> Heads of the Provinces, did obtain a certain Superiority upon the leſſer Churches that were in the little Villages of the Neighbourhood, becauſe of the need they had of them. The Metropolitan Cities were the dwelling places of the Governors of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Courts of Juſtice were there, 'twas thither they carried their Tributes; ſo that all the Provinces had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs there: beſides, the Biſhops of theſe Cities were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily more able than thoſe of little Cities; for it has always been the ordinary cuſtom to chooſe the ableſt men for the conduct of the moſt important Churches, and ſuch as were moſt expoſed to the Temptations of human Authority. Beſides this, there were in theſe Cities many Presbyters which aſſiſted the Biſhop, and who with him, made a Senate able and knowing in matters of Faith and Diſcipline. For theſe Reaſons the Churches of the Country, and ſuch as were Provincial, addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Churches of the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Cities in all their doubts, and in all their neceſſities: ſometimes to obtain Paſtors, ſometimes to know how they ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Hereticks, and thoſe which were ſcandalous, and ſometimes in other caſes, and on other occaſions. This was the reaſon that the Churches of the Metropolitan Cities obtained by conſent a kind of Superintendence over others. They confirmed, by impoſition of hands, <hi>Paſtors</hi> in vacant Churches, after the People of thoſe Churches had made an Election of them. This is the eſtate in which the Government was found in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Fourth Age. Before that time the Names of Arch-Biſhops, Primates, Exarchs, Patriarchs, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other Name of Power and Dignity, were wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the Church. But the Emperors becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Pride introduced it ſelf into the Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49990:164"/>and in the ſpace of an 150 years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, that Hierarchy was ſeen to be born and to eſtabliſh it ſelf, which certainly made way for the birth of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> and behold how it came to paſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the firſt Chriſtian Emperor, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Council in the City of <hi>Nice,</hi> to determine the Controverſie which <hi>Arrius</hi> had unhappily raiſed about the Divinity of the Son of God. The Council, after it had determined thoſe matters which reſpected Faith, were willing alſo to regulate matters of Diſcipline, and made twenty Canons concerning it: in which they cauſed thoſe Practices which were then in uſe, to paſs into Laws, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it may be, that they were much more ancient than indeed they were. For example, it found that the Churches had yet preſerved this mark of mutual Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that is to ſay, not to make void the judicial Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of one the other, and not to ſuffer that a perſon excommunicated in one Church ſhould have recourſe to another to be re-eſtabliſhed in its Communion. It made a Law thereof in the fifth Canon, <hi>As to thoſe that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Communion, be it that they are Layicks, be it that they are of the body of the Clergy, let the Biſhops of every Province obſerve this agreeably to the Canon that ſays, Let thoſe that are rejected by one, not be received by others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But finding alſo that it was a cuſtom, that in difficult matters reſpecting Faith or Diſcipline, when it happened that any Perſons were excommunicated or depoſed, the neighbouring Churches were wont to aſſemble to judge thereof, of that alſo it made a Law in the ſame Canon, and ordained, that for the examination of Cauſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by particular Churches <hi>a Synod ſhould aſſemble twice a year in every Province, to the end that the Biſhop of the Province being aſſembled, might examine theſe ſort of Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> As the Chymera of the Sovereign Authority of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils was not yet born, ſo the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> contented themſelves to ordain, That
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:49990:165"/>Provincial Councils ſhould be held, but gave no advice for the appointing General Councils, from ten Years to ten, as lately the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Nice</hi> alſo found, that by cuſtom, the Churches that had their Seats in Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick Cities, and entertained ſome ſuperintendency over the Churches of the leſſer Cities of the Province, they confirmed this uſage, and made a Law thereof in the ſixth Canon. <hi>Let the ancient Cuſtoms,</hi> ſay they, <hi>be obſerved, that is, that the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>have power over the Churches of</hi> Egypt, <hi>of</hi> Lybia, <hi>and</hi> Pentapolis, <hi>becauſe tis ſo alſo, that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>has been accuſtomed to have. In like manner at</hi> Antioch, <hi>and in the other Provinces, let the Priviledges of other Provinces be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi> There is nothing that has leſs foundation than the pretence of moſt part of the Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who imagin that here is the eſtabliſhment of thoſe Seats which were afterwards called Patriarchal: Neither the Name nor Power of Patriarchs were known at that time. And the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> had no other deſign, but to confirm by a Law, that which it found eſtabliſhed by cuſtom, that is to ſay, that the greater Churches ſhould have ſome ſuperintendency over the leſſer. There were then three great Governments in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Italy, Alexandria</hi> for the South, and <hi>Antioch</hi> for the Eaſt: The Churches which were in theſe three principal Cities of the Empire, had arrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome preheminence over the neighbouring Churches. The Council confirms to them this preheminence. But we may not imagin, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that the Council did then divide the whole Church into three Patriarchates, <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> as if all the other Churches had been ſubjected to theſe three: Theſe three Churches are named but for example, becauſe they were the principal. Beſides, it is added, <hi>Likewiſe, let the Priviledges be preſerved to other Churches;</hi> that is to ſay, let the Churches, which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49990:165"/>by cuſtom have obtained a ſuperintendency over their Neighbours, as leſſer Churches, preſerve that Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. So the Church of <hi>Aſia</hi> (which is not named in this Canon) is one of thoſe which had Preheminence over her Neighbours, to whom this Priviledge was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſome time. At that time therefore, by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and by the Law of the Council of <hi>Nice, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> had inſpection over the Churches of <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had inſpection over the ſuburbicarian Churches, that is to ſay, the Cities which were either of the Government of the Vicarſhip of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more. Now the Vicarſhip of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo far from extending it ſelf to the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that it extended to but about half <hi>Italy</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Naples;</hi> the other part of <hi>Italy</hi> which is on the ſide of <hi>Milan,</hi> was of another Vicarſhip, that is to ſay, of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Government, whereof the City of <hi>Milan</hi> was Capital, and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had nothing to do there. The Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> had inſpection over the Churches of <hi>Syria,</hi> and no more. The other Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire were independent of theſe three Seats, and had their Metropolitan Churches, under which they ranged themſelves for the aſſembling of their Synods, ſo that in the Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> nothing is found of the Inſtitution of Patriarchs, but only a Confirmation of the Priviledges that the Churches of the Metropolitan Cities had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conſent from the leſſer Churches round about them.</p>
            <p>It is nevertheleſs true, that ſoon after the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Biſhops of theſe three Cities, <hi>Rome, Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> began to play the Maſters, and to claim Right over the neighbouring Churches, much beyond the ancient uſe and intentions of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> They took advantage from this, that theſe three Cities were the three great Cities of the Empire; and becauſe they alone were named in the Canon of the Council, they made uſe thereof, ſay I, to extend their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49990:166"/>as we ſee: But it muſt be obſerved, that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice</hi> (having found, that by cuſtom the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Biſhops had inſpection over other leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cities, by contributing their aſſiſtance and their Care to eſtabliſh Biſhops there) did confirm alſo this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the ſame ſixth Canon. <hi>This muſt remain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> ſays the Council, <hi>that he who hath been made Biſhop without the Advice of the Metropolitan, the Great Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that he ought to be no Biſhop; but if Two or Three, through Obſtinacy and a Spirit of contradiction, oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an Eſtabliſhment made by a reaſonable common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and according to the Eccleſiaſtical Canons, let the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Voices prevail againſt them.</hi> This ſecond part of the Canon makes it appear ſufficiently plain, that in the firſt part thereof, nothing is handled concerning the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the pretended Rights of Patriarchs, but only of the Priviledges of the Metropolitan Cities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the Council will not ſuffer that any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Biſhops be made in the Cities of the Province.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops of theſe three Cities, <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> making uſe of the Canon of the Council, began to raiſe themſelves above all others. In the ſame time <hi>Byzantium,</hi> which had not been hitherto any other than a very obſcure Church, ſubject to the Metropolitan of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſees her ſelf honored by the preſence of the Emperors. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> carried thither the S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at of the Empire, and called it <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> after his own Name, and obtained for it the Name of <hi>New Rome.</hi> Then the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> began alſo to make uſe of an Advantage by the Dignity of the City where he was: So that inſtead of three Tyrants in the Church, which aſpired to make themſelves Maſters of the Flocks, there are found four; the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and he of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But as <hi>Rome</hi> always preſerved a Character of Greatneſs and Preheminence over other Cities, becauſe it was the ſtock and root of the Empire, they allowed a Primacy of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49990:166"/>to the Biſhop of that city without contradiction. And this by ſo much the more eaſily, as the Spirit which built the Myſtery of Iniquity had univerſally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Opinion, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> accounted the chief of the Apoſtles had placed his Epiſcopal Seat at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he eſtabliſhed Succeſſors; in ſuch a manner that all Biſhops in the World did ſilently conſent to grant this Primacy of Order, and of Preſidence to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for theſe two Reaſons: the firſt that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Capital of the Univerſe; the ſecond, that the chief of the Apoſtles had had his Seat there; ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was acknowledged for the firſt in order in their Aſſemblies, but without any kind of Power or Juriſdiction over others. In the mean time, the reſt of the Hierarchy was formed after the Model of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Empire. The <hi>Rome</hi> Empire in the Eaſt was divided into Five principal Governments:
<list>
                  <item>1. That of the Eaſt, whereof the Metropolis was <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> and which extending it ſelf over <hi>Syria,</hi> is called Eaſt by diſtinction from the other Oriental Provinces.</item>
                  <item>2. That of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe Head was <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whereof the Capital was <hi>Caeſarea.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. That of <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereof the Capital was <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. That of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whereof the Metropolis was <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> So that theſe five Cities, <hi>Antioch, Alexandria, Caeſarea, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were the places where the five great Governors of the Oriental part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had their abode. The Biſhops of the ſame Cities advanced themſelves alſo above the other Biſhops of the Provinces, and formed five Exarchates, <hi>i. e.</hi> five ſorts of Patriarchates independent the one from the other, in every one of theſe Exarchates or Patriarchates, there were many Biſhops, and even many Metropolitans in the ſenſe that the Word is taken at this day. The Exarchs of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and of <hi>Conſtantineple,</hi> every one in his Exarchate, was above the Biſhops in Government, whether they were Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49990:167"/>or ſimple Biſhops; ſo it was in the Weſt alſo. There was in <hi>Italy</hi> two principal Governments under the Name of Vicarſhips; the Government of <hi>Rome</hi> and that of <hi>Milan,</hi> for which reaſon the Biſhops of theſe two Cities imitating the Civil Government, advanced themſelves alſo in the Eccleſiaſtick, above the other Biſhops of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had therefore at that time a Primacy of Order and Preſidence, as we have obſerved, becauſe of the Preheminence of the City, and the falſe Opinion that had obtained, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had been Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there. But he exerciſed no Act of Juriſdiction or Superiority over others. It was not permitted him to receive Appeals, nor to make void the Deciſions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops. They were not the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> that called General Councils, they were the Emperors; it was not they that determined Controverſies of Faith, they were the Councils; they could not ſend out their Interdicts, nor Excommunications againſt other Churches, or conſtrain them to Obedience by any Cenſure. If the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſeparate other Churches from their Communion, other Churches alſo kept themſelves ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their Communion, adherence to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was of no neceſſity to obtain the eſteem of an Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and Catholick Church, and there were Churches in thoſe Ages which continued many Years in ſeparation, and without any Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without ever being eſteemed either Hereticks or Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. Nevertheleſs, it was in the Fourth Age, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſow the Seeds of his Tyranny, and took upon himſelf to judg thoſe which other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had already cenſured. And this happened chiefly on the occaſion of the Troubles which the Hereſie of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> raiſed in the Church. The <hi>Arrians</hi> became Maſters in the Eaſt, and drave the Orthodox Biſhops from their Seats, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria, Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Biſhops unjuſtly depoſed and driven away, retired themſelves into the Weſt, where Arrianiſm had made far leſs Ravages. The Biſhops of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49990:167"/>
               <hi>Milan, Rome,</hi> and the principal Seats of <hi>Italy,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Orthodox. S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and others came into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> to implore the Succour of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop thereof, and other Biſhops of the Weſt, to the end that by their Credit and Authority, as well with other Biſhops, as principally with the Emperors, they might be re-eſtabliſhed in their Seats. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> receives them, treats them as Biſhops, and declares that he had no regard for the unjuſt and violent Deciſions of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> yea he did all that was in his power to re-place them in their Seats. At this time, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the heat of theſe Controverſies ſtirred up by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the Biſhops of the Weſt which were Orthodox, held a Council at <hi>Sardis,</hi> in the Year 347. there to judge the Cauſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In this Council the Biſhops of the Weſt obſerving that the Violences which the Orthodox Biſhops of the Eaſt had ſuffered from the hands of Heretick Biſhops were without remedy, whilſt theſe Heretical Biſhops ſhould be abſolute Maſters, they thought fit to make three Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or Eccleſiaſtical Rules, according to which, when a Biſhop found himſelf oppreſſed by unjuſt Judgment, he might have recourſe to <hi>Rome;</hi> that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould have power to appoint a review of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and for that reaſon ſend Deputies on his part which ſhould cauſe a Synod of the Province to aſſemble and re-judg the matter a ſecond time, that in expectation of this ſecond Judgment, the Affairs ſhould remain in ſuſpence, and the place of the depoſed Biſhop ſhould not be filled. Behold exactly the fatal Point of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this tyrannical Power, which hath ſince ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up the Church. The truth is, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Sardis</hi> was made up of Weſtern Biſhops, which had no power to make Laws for the Eaſtern Church: It is alſo true, that the Churches of the Eaſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſcoffed at the Canons of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and never would receive them: It is alſo true, that in the Weſt it ſelf,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49990:168"/>theſe Canons were not received but very lately, and a long time after. But 'tis alſo true, that ſince that time the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have never ceaſed to make valid, and even to extend theſe Canons very far beyond their intention. They have been willing to perſwade, Firſt, That they have right to receive Appeals, whereas the Council of <hi>Sardis</hi> grants them nothing but the right of appointing a review, which is very much different from it. Secondly, And above all, they would make us believe that they have this Power by Divine Right, and from the Apoſtles, whereas they have it not, but by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of this Council of <hi>Sardis.</hi> In the Year 383, that is to ſay, about Sixty Years after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and Thirty ſix after that of <hi>Sardis,</hi> was held the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which is reckoned for the ſecond of thoſe which are called General, altho it were made up of an Hundred and fifty Fathers, and no more, and tho there were none at all of all the Weſt. This Council en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges and confirms the Hierarchy. But it did not yet eſtabliſh the Patriarchs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the four Seats which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have Dominion over all the Churches of the World: On the contrary, in the ſecond Canon it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Biſhops of one Dioceſs, i. e.</hi> of one <hi>Province,</hi> for then a Dioceſs did not ſignifie the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church of one Biſhop, 'twas a Collection of many Biſhops under one Exarch. It appoints, ſay I, <hi>That the Biſhops of one Province ſhould not intermeddle in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of another;</hi> and this without excepting the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. It appoints, <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>adminiſter only the Affairs of</hi> Egypt.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That the Biſhops of the Eaſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>of</hi> Syria, <hi>govern their Churches, preſerving to the Biſhop of</hi> Antioch <hi>the Preheminence that had been given him by the Council of</hi> Nice.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Aſia, whereof <hi>Epheſus</hi> was the Head, <hi>govern the Dioceſs of</hi> Aſia, without being ſubject to <hi>Antioch, Conſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>That the Churches of</hi> Thrace <hi>be governed by the Biſhops and Synods of the Province,</hi> without any other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:49990:168"/>
6. <hi>That the Churches amongſt the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions govern themſelves according to the cuſtom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> without Patriarchs and without Pope.</item>
               </list> There is no footſtep of any Papal Authority, nor even of any Patriarchal and Univerſal. In the following Canon we read theſe words, <hi>That the Biſhop of the City of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople <hi>hath the Privileges of Honor after the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>becauſe it is new</hi> Rome. A Canon which gives to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> nothing but Privileges of Honor and Preſidence, and grants them to be enjoyed by <hi>New Rome</hi> in the ſecond Place: For this reaſon the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would no longer ſit below the Biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> becauſe the City of their Seat was the Imperial City. This makes it appear, that the Biſhops had no Preheminence one before another, but by reaſon of the Cities where they had their Seats, and not by any divine Right. The Caſe is the ſame with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> That Biſhop gained nothing by all this, as is evident; nevertheleſs, the truth is, he always grew higher, according to the meaſure that the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy advanced. For the Exarchs aſſumed unjuſt Rights over thoſe which were merely Biſhops. The Biſhops of the Four firſt Seats, <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> raiſed themſelves by little and little above the Exarchs, and at laſt ſubjected and ſwallowed them up. Particularly he of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Ambition was not inferior to that of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Judg of the Exarchates of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that of the <hi>Barbarian</hi> Churches, with that of <hi>Thrace,</hi> which he had already. 'Twas in the Fourth Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil held at <hi>Calcedon</hi> in the Year 451. where it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that<note n="*" place="margin">Can. <hi>28.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The Church of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>ſhould enjoy the ſame Priviledges and Honours in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, ſeeing the City of</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>in Temporal Matters, did enjoy the ſame Priviledges and Honors with ancient</hi> Rome. But if <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did then exalt it ſelf, <hi>Rome</hi> did not do it leſs in proportion. Already the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49990:169"/>Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to Lord it over all the Weſt. <hi>Leo</hi> I. was placed in that Seat, a Man who had great Parts, but of great Pride, who played the Maſter in the Church: He declared that a Man is not of the Church, when he does not obey it; he proceeded ſo far as to ſay, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt intended that all his Gifts ſhould run down from the Chair of S.</hi> Peter, <hi>as from the Head, on all the Body of the Church, and that he which dared to ſeparate himſelf from the Chair of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ought to underſtand, that he is excluded from the divine Myſteries,</hi> i. e. <hi>from the Church.</hi> This was the <hi>Leo</hi> that obtained a Law from the Emperor <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by which he was eſtabliſhed Sovereign Judg of all other Biſhops; for which reaſon we take this Epiſcopacy of <hi>Leo</hi> for the firſt Point of the birth of the Antichriſtian Empire.</p>
            <p>This is enough for my end, which is not to give you a Hiſtory of the Hierarchy, and after that of the Papal Tyranny in all their Progreſſions, but only an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the Hiſtory of their birth in the Fourth and Fifth Ages. That which I have to obſerve for the concluſion of this Article, whereunto you ought to give good attention, is, that the brief Hiſtory that I have given you, is perfectly agreeable to the Spirit of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church at this day. She maintains
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is no more but a particular Church as others are.</item>

               <head>A Point of Controverſie. A Continuation of the matter of Schiſm. Although the Corruption of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were not extreme, yet it would not be lawful for us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither. Objections of the new Converts about it.</head>
               <p>MY Brethren, in the preceding Letter we have made it appear, that although we had been in the wrong in our Separation, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had not been corrupt, you would not wholly hazard your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by continuing out of it. I am at preſent to make it appear that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> being corrupt, with far greater reaſon you need fear nothing by not returning thither again. But for the greater illuſtration of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us ſuppoſe two ſorts of corruption, the one in ſome ſort tolerable, and the other wholly intolerable. Let us argue upon the firſt, and ſuppoſe that Perſons ſeparate themſelves from a Church which hath Errors in Doctrine, which nevertheleſs retains the Fundamentals in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, which hath Superſtitions, and thoſe very great, in its Worſhip, but which is no formally Idolatrous. Thoſe which ſeparate from ſuch a Church had done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if they had made no Separation. They ought to have attempted all ſorts of methods to have reformed their Church. Thoſe Remedies not ſucceeding but exaſperating the evil, they ought to exerciſe Patience, and to expect a more favourable time for Reformation. But ſuppoſing that whilſt theſe men employ methods of Softneſs, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inſenſibly grow warm, and fierce by the Contentions of Men, a thing which happens almoſt always, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily; ſuppoſing, ſay I, that the fierceneſs and heat of the one and the other Party thruſt on things to an entire Rupture and Schiſm, do you believe that the Party which ſeparates it ſelf from the main Body, and embraces a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more pure than that which it left, is obliged to return to the corrupt Party from which it is ſeparated?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49990:170"/>Not at all. It may, and ought to ſay, If things had proceeded otherways, 'tis true, we could have born for a while thoſe Corruptions which are in ſome ſort tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; but things, by the Providence of God, happening thus, we will ſtay where we are, and keep our ſelves in that Purity which we have choſen and not return to the corruption which we have forſaken. I do maintain that this ſeparated Church had reaſon, and were not obliged to return. It were not obliged to return for Salvation for having carried Chriſtianity with it, yea having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, it would be ſure that a man might be ſaved in its Communion. It will not be obliged for Edification, for 'tis not for Edification, that being in a pure Church we ſhould joyn our ſelves to another Church which we believe impure, and is really ſo. I go farther, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, That ſuch a ſeparate Church were obliged not to return to its corrupt ſtock. For when God hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated us from corruption, although this corruption be not extreme, we are obliged to keep far from it. 'Tis true that Preſervation of Peace is worth much; but 'tis a good thing which muſt not be purchaſed at the price of Truth. Schiſm which is making, and in action makes a great noiſe, and gives great ſcandal: for which reaſon I have ſaid, that when the corruption of a Church is in ſome ſort tolerable, it were better to ſuffer it than to make a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Separation: but the continuation of a Separation is not of the ſame ſcandal; Cuſtom reconciles us to every thing: and the ſcandal of ſuch a continuation is not ſo great that we ſhould ſacrifice important Truths for the ſake thereof.</p>
               <p>Let us at preſent apply theſe Reflections to the Subject that we are debating, and do the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that favour, to ſuppoſe, for one moment, as true that which is very falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that her corruption is in ſome ſort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; that ſhe hath Errors, but doth not ruine Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals; that ſhe is Superſtitious, but not Idolatrous.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49990:171"/>Let us ſuppoſe alſo, that for this reaſon our Fathers did not do ill in continuing for ſome time in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and exerciſing Patience therein. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at the ſame time, that things did not take this courſe there; that the Providence of God did otherwiſe diſpoſe thereof. Our Fathers did their duty in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reformation: they were obliged thereunto, altho the corruption were in that degree where we ſuppoſe it, <hi>i. e.</hi> tolerable. But whilſt the one demanded Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Zeal, and the other refuſed it with Paſſion, a Separation is made. There came Anathema's from <hi>Rome,</hi> and Thunders from the Temporal Powers, with Fires and Gibbets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which took from us the liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining there. It ſignifies nothing who had right or wrong in the manner of Separation: however it were, behold it done. Now I maintain, my Brethren, the thing being done, neither Edification, Conſcience, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor your Salvation, can ſuffer you to re-enter into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, although you ſhould ſuppoſe that her corruption is not extreme, but in ſome ſort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. Firſt of all, your Edification will not permit it. You ſuppoſe that the Worſhip of Images, the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, the Adoration of the Euchariſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are at leaſt great Superſtitions; how doth the Edification of the Church permit you to partake in all theſe things? The Edification of the Church obliges you to do all that you can to purge it from theſe Superſtitions; and your returning to a Union with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to confirm all Men in them. Conſcience will not permit it neither; for being convinced that they are Superſtitions, although you believe them in ſome ſort tolerable, you ought to have no more part in them. 'Tis a kind of Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt to ſin againſt Conſcience, and the Illuminations which God gives to you; and that which would be a ſmall fault in a ſtate of Ignorance and Error, becomes a great
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49990:171"/>crime, when 'tis committed againſt knowledge: ſo although the Invocation of Saints were but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fault in an ignorant and a prejudiced Papiſt, it is certain, that in you 'tis a heinous crime, becauſe you know the evil thereof. Don't ſay that you do not invocate Saints, for you do invocate them in the publick Service, wherein you do partake, and that is enough. I add, that neither will Honour permit this re-union with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even on ſuppoſition that her corruption is not extreme; for 'tis a ſhameful cowardize, and unworthy of an honeſt man, to betray his own Sentiments, and to give to a Church which he believes impure, that homage which is due only to a Church that is clean and undefiled. To conclude, I ſay, that your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will not permit you to put a period to your Separation from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that her corruption is in ſome ſort tolerable: for that corruption which might not deſtroy your Soul when you were there, having been educated, brought up, and inſtructed therein from your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, becomes mortal when you receive it, not having been born, brought up, nor inſtructed therein. The difference is clear, and the reaſon thereof is evident. It is certain that there is a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, ungrateful to God, which he tolerates in an ignorant Perſon, but he will not ſuffer nor endure it in a Man of Knowledge and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for a Perſon which practiſes a conſiderable Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition againſt his Conſcience, makes appear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Abyſs of Perverſeneſs, contempt of God, his Laws, and Truth, and ſuch a love of the World, and the intereſts of the Fleſh, which put him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely out of the ſtate of Salvation. Behold already ſomething advanced, to deliver you from thoſe vain horrors which they would thruſt upon you for your
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49990:172"/>Separation, under the name of Schiſm; for,
<list>
                     <item>1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Schiſm or Separation had been raſh, you would have no reaſon to be afraid of your Salvation.</item>
                     <item>2. Although the corruption of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had been in ſome ſort tolerable, and although there had been ſomething of Precipitation in the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nevertheleſs you would have no Obligation to return to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but you would be obliged to the contrary.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And here we ſhall find an occaſion to anſwer to the Fallacy which the new Converts (as they call them) put upon themſelves, and which we have mentioned in our Tenth Paſtoral Letter, and which is one of the moſt effectual means by which they lay themſelves to ſleep in that unhappy ſtate where they are. There is in it a Queſtion of Right, and another of Fact. The matter of Fact is to know whether indeed the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be corrupted to that degree that we report it. The Queſtion of Right is, Whether ſuppoſing the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corrupt, we may ſeparate our ſelves from it, and perſevere in that Separation to this day. We will firſt handle the Queſtion of Right, becauſe 'tis thereby that they enchant you, and thereby that the moſt part of you do quiet and calm your ſelves, 'tis thereby, ſay I, that they do enchant you; for your Converters following the Principles of the Author of the <hi>Legitimate Prejudices</hi> againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ferrand</hi>'s Treatiſe concerning the Church, tell you,<note n="*" place="margin">Book of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. <hi>p. 147, 148,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>That although the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>were Idolatrous and Heretical, the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>had no right to ſeparate themſelves from it, and to ſet up other Churches, and another Miniſtry.</hi> 'Tis alſo thereby that thoſe which would be at reſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do lull themſelves aſleep: for this Propoſition,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49990:172"/>that <hi>though the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were Heretical and Idolatrous you ought not to ſeparate from it,</hi> in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of your Converters Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> is nothing but a falſe Suppoſition, to make you ſee the more clearly the neceſſity of Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the horror of Schiſm. And if they found themſelves preſſed too hard on this ſpot of ground, they might be able always to retrench themſelves behind, and ſay, <hi>Now it is not true that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is Heretical and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</hi> But at this day one part of theſe new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, from a falſe Suppoſition draw a very ſolid Concluſion. They receive the Suppoſition as true, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is very corrupt; and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Theſis, That nevertheleſs they ought not to ſeparate from it; and that Men may or ought to return to it. We have heard the Reaſonings of one of theſe Men in our Tenth Letter; we muſt hear it once more; for he ſays all that theſe Men think. Speaking of the Queſtions which perplex the New Converts, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>on the poſitive Separation which ous Fathers made, we ſay, that we ought to ſuffer many things rather than ſeparate from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church; that the Abuſes introduced by the Governors thereof may not be imputed to the Faithful; that all Scripture which makes mention of Hereſies doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Separation for the ſake of them; on the contrary, it commands us to bear them. It ſays, that we may build upon the Foundation, which is Chriſt, Wood, Hay, and Stubble; that Jeſus Chriſt only will make Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the one from the other; that the good Grain and the Chaff will be ſeparated at the laſt day; but that they muſt grow together till then.</hi> After he adds ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on a Conjecture of the Author of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of Propheſies, which 'tis not neceſſary to report here, becauſe they will have their place
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49990:173"/>elſewhere. And he concludes this Points with theſe Words, <hi>And although the Pope ſhould be Antichriſt, that would not infallibly hinder Chriſtians from being ſaved in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi> The Letter contains another Article on the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the</hi> Roman <hi>Church be Idolatrous in worſhiping the Euchariſt, or Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt.</hi> This alſo ſhall have its place elſewhere. Afterwards he adds, <hi>At laſt they conclude two things; the firſt, That all the Fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity being confeſſed by the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, we are obliged to continue united with it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making a poſitive Separation, which is againſt all the duties of Charity, and which inſtead of bringing back thoſe which err, produces nothing but an eternal Diſtance and Animoſity. In the ſecond place, they do maintain, That we do not neceſſarily partake in the Errors of a Communion in which we are; the common Confeſſion of Faith ought to be eſteemed as an agreement to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Miniſtry: but we are not therefore reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for all the Abuſes which may be or can be introduced into the Miniſtry. Provided we adore the ſame God, and profeſs the ſame Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, the reſt cannot be imputed to ſingle Perſons, above all, when there is a neceſſity of joyning our ſelves to this firſt Chriſtian Society, and we cannot find any publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip more pure and more edifying. The Examples of our Fathers before the Reformation prove clearly, That we may ſecure our Salvation in the</hi> Roman <hi>Communion even in adhering to the publick Worſhip. Whatever Men ſay, it is inconceivable that Men born and brought up in a Religion, who never heard ſpeak of any other Doctrine, and who lived and died without proteſting againſt the Opinion of their Church, ſhould not partake in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thereof.</hi> Behold an exact account of all the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions which theſe new re-united Perſons put upon
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49990:173"/>themſelves, and an account which does honour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Spirit and Wit of him that made it. Would to God he would take as exact an account of his own Heart. Our Sheet being full, you ſhall have no Anſwer to theſe Juggles till the following Letters.</p>

            <p>SInce we entred into the Fourth Age, we found there three great Innovations, Monnachiſm, General Councils, and the Hierarchy. The fourth important Change, which altered the form of the Church happening in the Fourth and Fifth Ages, is the Worſhip of Creatures, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Relicks, and the Invocations of Saints. If there be any thing certain in the World, it is, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49990:174"/>this Worſhip was wholly unknown in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages; and no man can give attention to thoſe few Proofs that heretofore we have made thereof, without being convinced of it: 'tis certain that we have ſeen the Occaſions, and if I may ſo ſay, the Bloſſoms thereof, in that exceſſive reſpect which they had for the Perſons of their Confeſſors, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards which they had for their Interceſſions, and in the care that they took to collect their Bones, and to bury their Bodies honourably: and this is it which gave occaſion to the Pagans of accuſing the Chriſtians for worſhiping their Martyrs; as we have ſeen that the Jews of <hi>Smyrna</hi> did accuſe the Chriſtians thereof on the occaſion of the Body of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> which they hindred from being given unto them. This is that which cauſed the Pagans, under the Perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> to dig up the Bodies of thoſe two Martyrs <hi>Dorotheus</hi> and <hi>Gorgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and throw them into the Sea, <hi>For fear,</hi> ſaith Euſebius,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 8. Hiſt. Eccl. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>that if they continued in their Tombs they ſhould be adored and taken for Gods, according to the Opinion they had concerning us.</hi> We have ſeen how the Chriſtians of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> who tranſcribes their Epiſtle, did refute this calumny. Moreover, <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith in this laſt Paſſage, <hi>According to the Opinion that they have concerning us.</hi> This makes it appear, that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was falſe. They had therefore in the beginning of the Fourth Age a very great reſpect for the Tombs of <hi>Martyrs;</hi> but 'twas a thing unheard of, to open them, take out their Bones, and put them in Cheſts and Boxes, to the end that they might be ſcattered over all the World; yea long before in the fourth Age, St. <hi>Anthony</hi> being about to dye, declared that it was his Will that his Body ſhould be buried, and not kept upon a Bed, after the manner of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49990:175"/>Becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>'tis an affront, and a Violation of the Laws, not to bury the Bodies of the Dead, how holy ſoever they might be.</hi> Theſe were the laſt Words of dying Truth; for afterwards Men began to ſearch all Places, and to diſinterr the Bodies of Saints. The deceit of Prieſts, the Innocence of the People, and the malice of the Devil, advanced this unhappy Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. Perſons ran about in the ſearch of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, nor would they build any Temple or Church without them; they feigned Viſions and devious Dreams, which revealed unto them where the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Saints were laid, and they took the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bodies of Apoſtles and Martyrs from their Tombs, three hundred and four hundred Years after their Death. As it was impoſſible that this fooliſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition ſhould not ſoon degenerate into Idolatry, ſo it did not fail to come to paſs: for theſe Relicks drawn from their Tombs wrought Miracles, theſe Miracles were aſcribed to the Saints whoſe Relicks they were: Men could not fail of invoking thoſe Saints, which they believed did work Miracles in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe who did venerate and honour their Relicks. We ſee no ſenſible marks of the Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, till after the year of our Lord 360, and the moſt ancient Authors that ſpeak thereof are St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> not that we are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the People (the Authors of this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition) did not practiſe it a long time before, as in the time of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> we obſerve the Worſhip of Images to have taken its birth by the Superſtition of ſome ignorant People; notwithſtanding the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the People and Paſtors did not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be carried away to this unhappy Idolatry, till a long time after. In like manner, it may not be doubted, but that from the beginning of the Fourth Age, there were ſome ignorant Perſons among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49990:175"/>who ran into exceſs in the reſpect which they gave to the Aſhes of the Martyrs. But the practice did not become univerſal till the Fifth Age, and the Doctors and Teachers began not to be born down thereby, till about the end of the Fourth. And yet there was but little of it, for in all the former part of the Fourth Age, we ſee very few Monuments or Footſteps thereof in the Authors of thoſe times; but in the Fifth Age this Torrent ran with a prodigious ſwiftneſs, in ſuch a manner, that in leſs than Fifty Years this Superſtition became as it were the reigning Religion of the People. Behold then a matter of Fact, which we diſpute not with the Papiſts, 'tis, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the Fourth Age, ſome Examples of the Invocation of Saints are ſeen, and a great many more in the Fifth; ſo that it is to no purpoſe that they quote to us Paſſages from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to prove the Invocation of Saints in that Age; for 'tis a Point we do not diſpute with them. But we do maintain theſe Two things,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Worſhip of Saints took its original from that of Relicks, and that Men only invoked the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs whoſe Relicks they had.</item>
                  <item>2. That this Worſhip was new in that Age, and that it was unknown in the Ages preceding:</item>
               </list> The firſt Point will ſerve in what follows for a proof of the ſecond, which is the important Point we have to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> The novelty of this Worſhip in the Fourth and Fifth Ages.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We prove the novelty of this Worſhip by the ſilence of Chriſtian Authors during the ſpace of three Hundred or four Hundred Years. 'Tis a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſo many Writers having ſo much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak of the Martyrs and Saints, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid ſo much concerning them, did never find it convenient to ſpeak one word concerning the Worſhip and Honour that was to be given them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49990:176"/>their death. The leſſer Doctors among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, ſuch is that from whom Mr. <hi>Peliſſon</hi> produces a Latin Fragment, treat this negative Argument with Contempt; but no Man of good Senſe will treat it ſo, and no wiſe Man will ever perſwade himſelf, that for the ſpace of three Hundred and ſixty Years <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Ireneus, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Euſebius, Athanaſius, Hillary,</hi> and ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould not ſpeak one word of this religious Worſhip of Creatures, if it had been then in uſe. Beſides this negative Proof, we make uſe of all thoſe poſitive Proofs which we have proved from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third Age, by which it appears, that the Primitive Chriſtians invoked none but God, and that they did not invoke even Angels. 'Tis that which <hi>Origen</hi> hath plainly told us, and 'tis that which <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> had ſaid before him<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iren.</hi> lib. 2. cap. 58.</note>: <hi>That the Church doth nothing by the Invocation of Angles, nor by any other wicked Curioſity, but by Addreſſing purely, plainly, and openly her Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Lord the maker of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among theſe poſitive Proofs, we have ſeen ſome of them which formally tell us, that the Church neither worſhips, invokes, nor adores Martyrs, ſuch is the Epiſtle of the Chriſtians of <hi>Smyrna</hi> about the Martyrdom of <hi>Polycarpus.</hi> Is it not therefore an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing boldneſs in your Converters to mantain to you, that there was no change in the Doctrine and Practice of the Church thereon in the Fourth Age? 'Tis clear that Men did not invoke Saints in the Third Age; it is clear that they began to do it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the Fourth; it is therefore clear, that a Change did happen. But they will ſay, where is the Author of this Change? Where is the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator? This Queſtion is abſurd. 'Twas not one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon that introduced this alteration in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49990:176"/>'twas the ſuperſtitious People, the great reſpect which the People ſaw Men had for the Tombs of Martyrs carried ſome Dotards to advance, that the Souls of Martyrs were about their Tombs. And 'tis apparently according to the conjecture of <hi>Albeſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> that which the Thirty fourth Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Eliberis</hi> hath reſpect unto<note n="*" place="margin">Albaſp. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Concil. Eliberitan.</note>, <hi>That we ought not to light up Torches in the day time in the Coemetaries, leſt we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Spirits of the Saints.</hi> They imagined that theſe Spirits fluttering about their Tombs, might ſuffer inconvenience by the Smoak of Torches and Candles. Is not this a pleaſant Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination? S. <hi>Jerome</hi> writing againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi> doth alſo ſay, <hi>That the Souls of Martyrs love their Aſhes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver about then, and are always preſent with them.</hi> We know that the Vulgar are naturally inclined to Superſtition, and 'tis eaſie to conceive how the People inſtructed in ſuch an Opinion ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an extraordinary reſpect for thoſe places, where were the Bodies and Souls of Martyrs: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that theſe. Souls which converſed about their Tombs, had alſo the liberty of flying back to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when they thought good; it was very eaſie for ignorant People to fall into a perſwaſion that it was very good to recommend themſelves to their care and interceſſion: There was therefore no need of an Innovator or a new Preacher, nothing more was needful, but to let the People do as they pleaſed. Mark this well, all Hereſies have been introduced by Doctors, for there is need of Wit and Knowledg to innovate in Opinions; but all Superſtitions have been introduced by the People: For nothing more is needful to become ſuperſtitious, than Sottiſhneſs, Simplicity, and Ignorance; therefore the Authors of Innovation in Doctrine may be obſerved, for they
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49990:177"/>are ordinarily ſingle Perſons; but we cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the firſt Innovators in matter of Superſtition, becauſe they are the People. But it will be ſaid, why did not the Doctors oppoſe themſelves to the Superſtition of the People? Firſt, it is not true, that the Doctors did not oppoſe themſelves to Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at their birth. S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and S. <hi>Jerome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf blamed the Superſtitions which began to take place in their Age, and which afterwards overcame all Contradiction. But nevertheleſs 'tis true, that they did not oppoſe them as they ought to have done, yea, that they ſuffered themſelves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with them as others did, becauſe that theſe Superſtitions were eſtabliſhed by little and little, and that the beginnings which the Doctors did eaſily ſuffer (becauſe 'twas but a ſmall matter) gave place to the toleration, of that which was introduced after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which nevertheleſs was altogether intolerable. To conclude, 'tis of little importance to us, how and why the Doctors ſuffered themſelves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Errors and popular Superſtitions. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact is certain, and ought to be indiſputable, by the proof that we have made thereof, and by that which we ſhall make thereof in what follows.</p>
            <p>Our Second Proof of the novelty of this Worſhip in the Fifth Age is, that then Men did not invoke all the Saints, as 'tis done at this day; yea, they did not invoke thoſe Saints which are moſt eminent, ſuch were the Apoſtles, excepting S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe Relicks were believed to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> others had no Churches, Temples, Memorials, nor Perſons devoted to them. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> the moſt ancient of all thoſe which ſpeak of the Invocation of Saints, cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates the Memory only of the Forty Martyrs, that of <hi>Julitta,</hi> and the Martyr <hi>Mamas:</hi> In this Homily upon <hi>Julitta</hi> the Martyr, there is nothing that teaches
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49990:177"/>us they did invoke her: In the Homily upon the Forty Martyrs, he ſays indeed, that Perſons fled to them for refuge, and that <hi>the pious Wife prayed there for her Children, that ſhe there deſired the return of her abſent Husband, and his Health when he was ſick:</hi> Firſt it appears, that this was the Devotion of Women, who are inclined to Superſtition. Secondly, 'tis not very clear, that theſe Prayers were addreſſed to Martyrs; for in the beginning, theſe Prayers are addreſſed to the God of Martyrs, with reſpect to the Merits and Sufferings of Martyrs, to whom God would do Honour by Miracles. 'Tis true, that in the Homily on the Martyr <hi>Mamas,</hi> the Invocation of the Saint appears more expreſs. But obſerve, that this <hi>Julitta,</hi> this <hi>Mamas,</hi> and theſe Forty Martyrs were obſcure Saints, and of little Reputation in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Apoſtles, concerning the Invocation of whom, S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks not one word. This is a ſtrange thing, and that whereof they know not how to give us a reaſon. Make the ſame obſervation upon the Paſſages of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which they quote unto you for the Invocation of Saints: He there ſpeaks of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of S. <hi>Protais,</hi> and of S. <hi>Garvais;</hi> Good God! what Saints are theſe in compariſon of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>John.</hi> 'Tis true, that this Father ſpeaks of the Invocation of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> the firſt Martyr. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eminent this great Saint was, he was but a Deacon, and we ought not to make him equal with the Apoſtles. Nevertheleſs there appears no Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Apoſtles in the Writings of S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> I call not this a ſimple Proof, 'tis a Demonſtration of the Novelty of this ſuperſtitious Worſhip. If the Worſhip and Invocation of Saints were ancient, if they were from the time of the Apoſtles, why is it we ſee ſo few Saints called upon in the Fourth Age? Why did they not call upon S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:49990:178"/>the Apoſtles? Is it not clear from thence, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtles, nor the Apoſtolick Church did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute this Worſhip? Why did they forget all the Saints of the Old Teſtament, and almoſt all thoſe of the firſt and ſecond Ages of the Church? 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it was Mens Superſtition for Relicks which gave birth to this Superſtitious Invocation, and that then they invoked only thoſe whoſe Relicks they believed they had, as I ſhall make appear in what follows.</p>
            <p>Behold a third demonſtrative Proof of the Novelty of this religious Invocation of Saints. 'Tis that in the ſame Age in which they invoked Saints, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally condemned the Invocation of Angles. <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> is aſſuredly one of thoſe Authors of the fifth Age, where we ſee the moſt expreſs Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. <hi>8.</hi> De curandis Graec. affect.</note>: nevertheleſs the ſame Author condemns the Invocation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in a manner ſo expreſs, that one knows not what to anſwer to it. 'Tis in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on thoſe Words of the ſecond Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians, Let no man perſuade you through humility to the Worſhip of Angels: Thoſe which were for the Law,</hi> ſays <hi>Theodoret, perſuaded Men alſo to the Worſhip of Angles, ſaying that the Law was given by Angels; and this Superſtition continued a long time in</hi> Piſidia <hi>and</hi> Phrygia, <hi>for which reaſon a Synod aſſembled at</hi> Laodicea, <hi>the Metropolis of</hi> Phrygia, <hi>made a Law to hinder the Invocation of Angels.</hi> Behold the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and fantaſtical Conceit that ever was. It is certain by the Scripture, and the conſent of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that Angels are adminiſtring Spirits ſent forth for thoſe which ſhall inherit Salvation; they are in our Churches, they aſſiſt at our Aſſemblies, and by conſequence hear and underſtand us; moreover, they give an account to God of their conduct: they know
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49990:178"/>what we do; they hear our Prayers; whereas accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of the Doctors of the Fourth and Fifth Ages, it was very uncertain whether the dead Saints did hear the Prayers of the Living, and yet more uncertain whether God gave them any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Charge with reſpect to us; nevertheleſs they look'd upon it as an impious folly to adore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but were willing it ſhould be accounted a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Worſhip to invoke a Saint. What a fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Imagination is this? And is it not clear that this ſavors of Superſtition in its birth, which hath as yet no Principles, and which guides it ſelf by the practice of the People, and eſtabliſhes it ſelf upon popular Errors? We have yet ſome invincible Proofs of the Novelty of this Worſhip, but we will reſerve them for the following Letter.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:49990:179"/>
               <head>An Article of Controverſie. An Anſwer to the Reaſons of the New Converts on the Subject of Schiſm and Separation.</head>
               <p>AT the end of the preceding Letter, we heard the Reaſons which the New Converts offer to themſelves, to abide peaceably in the Eſtate where Violence hath placed them. Behold exactly the Diſpoſition of theſe Gentlemens minds: they find ſome difficulty to reſolve to acknowledge that there is Idolatry in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or rather, they find it difficult to confeſs it; for at the bottom, we may believe they are convinced thereof. But this Point being excepted, they do confeſs that there are all ſorts of Corruption in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; that the Real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation, are Errors; that the Sacrifice of the Maſs eſtabliſhed only upon this Tranſubſtantiation is therefore a falſe Sacrifice; that Adoration, which is a conſequence of the real Preſence (as they pretend) is ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that Maſſes, without Communicants, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt; that the Privation of the Cup is criminal; that Purgatory is a dream; that Service for the Dead, Maſſes, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Indulgences, are Superſtitions; that the Invocation of Saints, the Worſhip of <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> which is given to the Bleſſed Virgin, the Service of Images, Veneration for Relicks, are loathſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made to Chriſtianity, and that they pollute and diſhonour it; that the Latin Tongue, to very ill purpoſe, hath been preſerved in the Publick Worſhip, to rob the People of that Edification
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49990:179"/>which they might find by underſtanding what was ſaid, that the Government is tyrannical, that the Pope uſurps a Power which appertains not to him, and that it may be he is Antichriſt, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo far from being Infallible, that ſhe hath erred in a Hundred and a Hundred things. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſay I, exactly, the Idea which theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men form of Popery: Nevertheleſs, they prove by Reaſons which we have heard, that they may continue there. Now upon this ſuppoſition let us hear them ſpeak, and examin their Opinions one after another.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, <hi>That we muſt ſuffer, and not ſeparate from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church.</hi> My dear Brethren, who ſeek to deceive your ſelves, hear me: What is this Unity of the Church, according to your Principles, from which we muſt not ſeparate? Do you believe that this Unity of the Church is the Unity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? If it be ſo, according to you, there is no Church out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion; if there be no Church out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, there is then none among the Chriſtians of the Eaſt which are out of the Communion of the Pope, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church. If there be no Church out of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion, there is no Salvation out of it; and if no Salvation, it follows that you damn all thoſe Men which are in thoſe Chriſtian Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome whereof are far leſs corrupt than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. But that is not all; in the Church where you have lived hitherunto, and where your Fathers died, there hath been no Church; for what reaſon? Becauſe theſe Aſſemblies, according to you, were out of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church.</hi> Nevertheleſs, you do acknowledg, that the Aſſemblies of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had a Chriſtianity more pure, without Maſs,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49990:180"/>Images, Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Language in the Worſhip of God, and other Superſtitions, and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath all theſe; ſo that you will put the Church, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Society where Chriſtianity is altogether corrupt, according to you, and you will take it from a Society where, in your own opinion, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is intirely pure. Are not theſe fooliſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſuch whereof you will be aſhamed, my Brethren, as ſoon as you ſhall duly conſider them? It comes from this, that you are willing to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Form of the Communion in which you are entered, with thoſe ſentiments of Truth which you have preſerved in your Hearts. They inculcate theſe Maxims to your Ears continually. Unity muſt not be broken, you muſt not go our of it. There is but one Church, you ought to keep in it, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is to go out of the Unity. Theſe miſerable Juggles have ſome probability, whilſt we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth, that the Church is included in her Communion, that ſhe is Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that out of her there is no Salvation: But this Language becomes a frightful Gibberiſh in the mouth of Men which are convinced as you are,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the other Communions of Chriſtians which do not adhere to <hi>Rome,</hi> are nevertheleſs as much Chriſtians, or more, than ſhe.</item>
                     <item>2. That your Fathers doing ill in ſeparating, nevertheleſs did well in purging Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and that their Chriſtianity is intirely pure.</item>
                     <item>3. That the Communion of our Reformers was not dangerous, and that a Man might be ſaved therein, yea, much more eaſily than in that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe he would not have the trouble of making a Separation in his Mind of true Opinions from falſe ones.</item>
                     <item>4. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49990:180"/>is corrupt.</item>
                     <item>5. That in ſeparating from it, a Man ſeparates from the Corruption without ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Chriſtianity, ſeeing that he carries that which is Chriſtian along with him.</item>
                  </list> Behold, ſay I, that which you think, and that which the exact account of your Illuſions ſpeak, being formed by one of your ſelves. Now ſee how this agrees with this Unity, and with ſeparation from that Unity whereof you ſpeak: For if the Church be out of the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> I may go out of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion without going out of the Church, and by conſequence without ſeparating my ſelf from the Unity; where the Church is, there is the Unity. If the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be corrupt, as you confeſs, by ſeparating from that which is corrupt in her, a Man does not ſeparate from the Unity, ſeeing that Unity is not in Corruption, it is in Chriſtianity. If a Man may be ſaved out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as you do fully believe, not concluding us damned, we are not out of the Unity; for whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is out of the Unity, is out of a ſtate of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Salvation is not found, but in the Church, which is one, and which alone poſſeſſes Unity. In the Name of God, my Brethren, learn by this Example not to ſpeak without underſtanding what you ſay, to pleaſe your Converters, and above all your own Self-Love.</p>
               <p>But let us return and retake the ſame Opinion. <hi>'Tis ſaid, that we muſt ſuffer without ſeparating from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church.</hi> I intreat you, my Brethren, how far muſt this Toleration go? Set me the Bounds unto which my Toleration muſt proceed, that I may continue in this pretended Unity. Are you of the opinion of M. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and of M. <hi>Ferrand, That though the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were Heretical and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49990:181"/>yet we ought not to ſeparate from it by a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Separation;</hi> all that we are obliged unto, is not to communicate in its Hereſies and Idolatries; I do very well perceive, that the inclinations of your own Hearts would carry you even thither; and indeed, that is needful to ſet you in full ſecurity. For whilſt you ſay, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be not Idolatrous, although ſhe be very corrupt, we ought nevertheleſs to continue there; you will never have your Hearts at caſe and liberty, and you will never be without Fears leſt the Invocation of Saints, Worſhip of Images, and the Euchariſt ſhould be Idolatry. The Heart finds it difficult to reſt upon an <hi>it may be;</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is not <hi>it may be</hi> Idolatrous; ſo that to procure that falſe Peace which you ſeek after, you muſt diſenthral your ſelves, and ſay with your Converters, <hi>That though the</hi> Roman <hi>Church were Heretical and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, we ought not to ſeparate from it.</hi> My Brethren, I knock hard at the door of your Conſciences; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake you that ſleep, and behold the horror of this Propoſition. If it be true, we know not reaſonably how to give any bounds to this toleration for the Errors of the Church. If we ought to continue there, though ſhe become Idolatrous and Heretical, we muſt continue there if ſhe embrace the Hereſie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who believed two Gods and two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; if ſhe embrace the Error of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deſtroy the Trinity and Incarnation, who deny both the Reſurrection of the Body and Immortality of the Soul. We muſt continue there though ſhe embrace Mahametiſm, and adore the Sun and Moon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe continue to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, and bear the Name of Chriſtian. Are ye able to ſtand firm againſt theſe frightful Conſequences? Every Church which is not Infallible, but may err and be corrupt,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49990:181"/>may aſcend to the higheſt degree of Corruption: For who is it that ſhall ſtay it in the midſt of its deſcent from a Precipice, or hinder it from tumbling to the bottom? Tell me, do you believe that a Society which becomes indeed Heretical and Idolatrous, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at the ſame time the true Church, and the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt? Is there any thing more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Chriſtianity than Idolatry? How will you reconcile this? It is true, that God who is rich in means and ways of bringing Men to Salvation, may ſave ſome Perſons in Idolatrous Communions: This is that which we ſhall conſider, and therein we ſhall follow the order of your Ratiocinations: But doth it follow from thence, that therefore we muſt tolerate Idolatry and Hereſie, without ſeparating from it? This is that which we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, make a third Reflection upon this unhappy Principle; <hi>We muſt ſuffer the Corruption of the Church, rather than ſeparate from its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> And give me leave to tell you, that in the apprehenſions wherein you now are, there are the looſeſt Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind which can happen to Men of Honor, ſuch as you make profeſſion to be; for you are not of opinion, that the Corruption of the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf only to Manners and Diſcipline; you confeſs that it extends to all things, you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that her Errors and Superſtitions are light and ſmall, and how can your Conſcience be otherwiſe than dead and paſt all feeling, to have Churches full of Images, before which Men offer Prayers, Incenſe, Supplications, Adorations, and Homages to Creatures, to Saints and Sainteſſes; to have withdrawn the Cup, made a falſe Sacrifice, covered a hidden divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice under a barbarous Language, to amuſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49990:182"/>with Relicks, Bones, Indulgences, Stations, Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How, ſay I, are you able not to perceive, that this is not an extreme Corruption? But what need have I to ſollicit your Conſcience thereon? Your mouths ſpeak, and your ſelves tell us; <hi>though the Pope he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> we may not ſeparate from him: This is that which I call the looſeſt Opinion that can be imagined; to perceive that a Man is in a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo corrupt, that it may well be Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to ſay that we may not ſeparate our ſelves from it: Tell me, I pray you, is the ſtate of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in which you find the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is it, ſay I, the natural ſtate of the Church? Is it well in this condition? You will anſwer me, no: If your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer be true and ſincere, is it not true, that 'tis my Duty to do all that I can to recover the Church from this ſtate of Corruption, becauſe it is a ſtate of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and againſt Nature? Now how can we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Church from this Corruption, but by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating our ſelves from it? You will ſay, we ought to continue in it, and remonſtrate againſt its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But you know well that this is impoſſible, you know that they burnt our Fathers, becauſe they made remonſtrance againſt it. By continuing and remonſtrating againſt Idolatry and Superſtition, ſhould we not be immediately ſeized by the Inquiſition, or by the Biſhops and ſecular Judges, where there are no Inquiſitors? Should we not be put in Priſon, hanged, and burnt? Therefore it is neceſſary that we go out, or remain there in ſilence. Now behold, what kind of looſneſs is this, to know that we are in a very corrupt Communion, and which is, it may be, Antichriſtianity, and to keep and continue there without ſaying any thing! If this ſtate of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be violent to the Church, if it be contrary to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49990:182"/>the nature of it, certainly the intention of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to leave her always in it; for the intention of God is, that when things are at a diſtance from their own natural ſtate, they ſhould return unto it as ſoon as may be. Now with what means can God ſerve himſelf for the Reformation of the Church? Certainly he ought to ſerve himſelf of Men; for it is not his ordinary method of proceeding, to ſend Angels to preach upon earth. Now how can theſe Men reform the Church, if they do not repreſent unto her her Corruption, and if they do not break with her in caſe ſhe do not reform? If ſeparation be not granted, Reformation will never happen: For a Church perſwaded that ſhe is pure, and even Infallible, takes no care to renounce thoſe Doctrines and Worſhips, for which ſhe produces to you a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of many Ages, and a Title of Infallibility. Tell me a little, I intreat you, my Brethren, what will you do to reform the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, by continuing in it? If you ſpeak freely, ſaying, that her Worſhip, Innovations, and Adorations of Creatures, are true Idolatries, they will ſend you the Dragoons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure hang you: If you hold your peace, will your ſecret Sighs and Groanings reform the Church? Will God ſend from Heaven a ſecret and immediate Inſpiration for Reformation, though no body ſpeak one word of it. And this in the favour of whom? Either the ancient Catholicks who are plunged in Superſtition, or in favour of many ancient illuminated Papiſts, and thoſe that are re-united to them, who, both one and the other, are looſe Diſſemblers which retain the Truth of God in unrighteouſneſs? You ought to underſtand at preſent, my Brethren, that we ſhall never attain the end of reforming the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, unleſs we have right to go out of it;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:49990:183"/>becauſe ſhe will never ſtir for Complaints and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; experience has made it plain enough: And therefore the temper of your Soul ought to be ſuch as this, rather than move our ſelves, and trouble our repoſe, 'tis better that we ſuffer the Church to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be overwhelmed with Corruption. This, ſay I, is the moſt wicked ſentiment which can enter into the Mind of an honeſt Man, and much more of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But let us continue the examination of your Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: <hi>Abuſes introduced by Governours may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to private Chriſtians,</hi> you tell us. This is it which we will refute in that which follows, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we go on: <hi>All the holy Scripture which makes mention of Hereſies, doth not command Separation.</hi> How dare you ſay this? Do you not read that Paſſage ſo expreſs? <hi>Go out of</hi> Babylon <hi>my People, for fear leſt by partaking in its Sins you partake in its Plagues:</hi> This <hi>Babylon</hi> is a falſe Church, which ſays of her Church, <hi>I am a Queen, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow:</hi> I am the Church which cannot fail. It imports not at preſent where this Church is; but do you not ſee, that God commands thoſe that are there to go out of it? Wherefore doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to his Diſciples, <hi>A man that is an heretick, after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, reject.</hi> How can a Perſon ſhun any one, and ſtand at a diſtance with him without Separation from him? Doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to the <hi>Corinthians, Put from among you that wicked perſon;</hi> will you reſtrain theſe wicked Perſons to the vicious, and except the Hereticks? See how the ſame Apoſtle deſcribes thoſe Hereticks that denied the Reſurrection? he ſays<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.</note>, <hi>That as to the faith, they made ſhipwreck thereof, that their words
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49990:183"/>eat like a gangreen, that they have proceeded even to impiety, and that they are veſſels of diſhonour.</hi> Theſe are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wicked Wretches, and by conſequence ought to be caſt out. Do you not remember, the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galathians, That if any none preach to you any other Doctrine beſides that which you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, let him be to you Anathema.</hi> Do you believe that it is allowed you to adhere to thoſe which you ought to have in execration, and to whom you ought to ſay <hi>Anathema?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Scripture on the contrary exhorts us to a mutual ſupport of each other.</hi> And where is it that you find this? It exhorts you to ſupport the weak, but about what? About the diſtinction of Meats, about the uſe of ſome Ceremonies of little importance. Behold the things about which St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands that we bear with each other.<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Now as to him which is weak in the Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to you, but not to doubtful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; one believes that he may eat all things, another that is weak eateth herbs.</hi> But where do you find that we muſt tolerate Hereſies, which ruine the Worſhip of the true God, and oppreſs and ſink Chriſtianity under a heap of Superſtitions? But I will confound you with your own Weapons. If it be the Spirit of Chriſtianity, and of the true Church, to tolerate Abuſes and Corruptions, you are not in the true Church, for that Church will allow no Toleration; ſhe burns and condemns to Death. If we are obliged to ſuffer her in her Corruptions, at leaſt ſhe is obliged to bear with us in our Complaints and Admonitions. If we ought to hear with her when ſhe ſpeaks falſe, with much more reaſon ſhe ought to bear with us when we tell her the Truth.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49990:184"/>She hath no Charity, ſhe is cruel, erroneous, and raging in her Error. See if you can have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with ſuch men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Scripture ſays that we may build upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which is Chriſt, Wood, Hay, and Stubble.</hi> Do you underſtand, that this Wood, Hay, and Stubble, which we may ſafely build, are Idolatries, Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines, Depravations in Morality, monſtrous and enormous Opinions, ſuch as are found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Is that it which you think? But to perſuade our ſelves into the belief of ſo great a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, we muſt have either Authorities of Reaſons. For Reaſons, have you any which can perſuade you, that the Invocation of Saints, by which are given to the Bleſſed Virgin all the Title, Attributes, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, Powers and Homages which appertain to the Deity: That the Worſhip of Images, by which we proſtrate our ſelves before Wood and Stone againſt an expreſs Prohibition of the Law, by which we adore that which is but Bread: That the ſetting up a new, real, and true Sacrifice, unknown to Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles: That the taking the half of one Sacrament, and the addition of five whole ones: That to cover a ſuperſtitious Worſhip, and bury it in a barbarous Language; do you believe, ſay I, that all this is called Wood, Hay, and Stubble? Doth not ſound Senſe tell you, that Wood, Hay, and Stubble are light are trifling things, but that they are not fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and wicked, and by conſequence that it doth not repreſent any thing but light and trifling Doctrines, but ſuch as have nothing in them that is filthy or evil, ſuch as are beſides the Word of God, but not againſt it? There is no Man which does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this; and he muſt be blinded by Intereſt not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49990:184"/>to ſee a thing ſo obvious and viſible. You have not therefore any reaſon to put the pernicious Doctrines of Popery amongſt Wood, and Hay, and Stubble: nor have you any Authority for it. I do not know any Text of Scripture which may make you ſuſpect, that God is not jealous of ſeeing you give that Worſhip to Creatures, which is due only to the Creator. He hates Idolatry, and defines it by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Honor to another, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I will not give my glory to another.</hi> Now are not Temples, Sacrifices, Prayers, Vows, Oaths, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, the Honors due to God? and by conſequence, they not of the number of thoſe things of which he ſays, <hi>I will not give my Glory to another?</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in Popery they are given to the Saints, and above all, to the Bleſſed Virgin. You may fairly pluck out your eyes, you cannot hinder your ſelves from ſeeing it; and in what follows we ſhall have an opportunity to prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt alone,</hi> you add, <hi>will make Separation of this Wood and this Gold; the good and the fair Grain ſhall be ſeparated at the laſt day, but we muſt let them grew together till then.</hi> I fear, my Brethren, that if you go on to blind your ſelves, God will abandon you to your darkneſs. You are ſtrange Commentators on the Goſpel Text, you ought firſt to read the Interpretation which the Lord gives of the Parable, before you give your own: Behold it proceeding out of the Mouth of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>He which ſowed the good ſeed is the Son of Man, the field is the World; the good ſeed are the children of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Tares are the children of the wicked one. The field is the World,</hi> then 'tis not the Church; 'tis therefore in the World that we ought to tolerate
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49990:185"/>Hereticks and Idolaters, and not in the Church. But beſides know two things, 1. That Parables are good Proofs when we don't abuſe them; but 'tis very eaſie to abuſe them, when Piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth not guide us. I compare you to your Converters, who at this day preſs thoſe Words of the Parable of the Marriage Supper ſo hard, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to come in.</hi> Behold their Text, <hi>Let them grow together till the Harveſt, and then I will ſeparate them;</hi> behold yours. The one and the other is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily wreſted and turned to another ſenſe, becauſe Men will not enter into the Spirit of the Parable, which is the only thing eſſential, and to which we muſt give attention to make a good uſe of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes. It is therefore neceſſary, in the ſecond place, that you learn the deſign and inward mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Words, <hi>Let them grow together till the Harveſt,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis to ſhew the Patience of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wicked, and not the Patience that we ought to have towards them. God repreſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Maſter which hath Right to deſtroy the World, and ruine both good and bad; becauſe that the Wicked are infinitely the greater number in the World than the Good. But he will not do it. He ſtays to diſplay his greateſt Judgments upon the World till the laſt day, when he will make a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Good from the Bad: therefore he has no deſign to teach us, that we muſt peaceably ſuffer Hereſies and Idolatries to grow together with the Truth: and I can prove it by a hundred Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but I will content my ſelf to ſhew you that theſe Words, <hi>Let them grow together, &amp;c.</hi> cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, Let Hereſies grow together, ſuffer them, and live peaceably in a corrupt Church; ſince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of God, on the contrary, is, that with all our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49990:185"/>Strength we pluck up the Tares out of the Field of the Lord; <hi>That he hath appointed us to ſay Anathema to him who ſhall preach any other thing to us than what hath been preached in the Goſpel; that we ſhould avoid an Heretick, that we ſhould caſt the Wicked out from among us; that we ſhould go out from</hi> Babylon, <hi>and that we ſhould not drink of the Cup of her Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If the end of the Parable, <hi>Let them grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till the Harveſt,</hi> were that which you give to it, we ſhould have no right to drive from our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety neither the Vicious, nor the Troublers of the Church, nor any ſort of Criminals. A Magiſtrate might not hang a Murderer, nor burn a Sodomite. It might be always ſaid unto him, <hi>Let them grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till the Harveſt.</hi> I may add to this, that by the Tares which grew up with the good Grain, we muſt underſtand Hypocrites and falſe Chriſtians. Now 'tis true that we muſt have this kind of men, and give them up to the judgment of God; for he only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knows them, and hath the only right to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. We will anſwer to the reſt of your dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the following Letter.</p>
               <p>The Uniformity of the Perſecution is the cauſe that we have leſs of Hiſtory to furniſh you withal. 'Tis always and every where the ſame. Perſons are impriſoned, others are ſent to the Gallies, Women are ſhut up in Cloyſters, Bodies are drawn on Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and thrown to the Dunghil: ſo that it will be always the ſame thing; there will be nothing but differing Names, which may increaſe the horror which you have for the Perſecution, as you ſee the rage of your Perſecutors increaſe: for example, in that kind of Executions which are made upon the Bodies of thoſe which will not communicate in their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49990:186"/>laſt Sickneſs. Was there not ſomething ſingular in the Cruelty which was exerciſed on the Body of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man about 60 years of Age, who died at <hi>Soubize</hi> the 16th of <hi>November</hi> in the Year paſt? This Woman was called <hi>La Jarnat,</hi> Widow of one named <hi>Rame;</hi> fell ſick about the end of the Month; during her Sickneſs, the Curate and the Officers of Juſtice em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Exhortations, Threatnings, Kindneſs, and Terrors, to obtain of her to communicate againſt her Conſcience, <hi>i. e.</hi> that ſhe would damn her ſelf with all poſſible care. This poor Woman, fearing God more than Men, reſiſted all their Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſtantly refuſed to participate in this falſe Myſtery, which would have deprived her of true Communion with Jeſus Chriſt. After her Death the Juſtice ſeized on her Body, and before Sentence was pronounced againſt her, they plucked out her Eyes, they cut off her Noſe, pulled out her Tongue, they cut off her Fingers and Toes, her Lips and Ears, and committed thoſe kind of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities on this poor Body which we dare not name. Good God! What Spirit is this, what kind of fury? And of what Perſons did the Holy Spirit ſpeak, if it be not of theſe men, when it ſaid, <hi>Even the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſters draw out the breaſt, they give ſuck to their young ones, but the Daughter of my People is in the hands of cruel and barbarous perſons like the Oſtriches in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> [So ſome tranſlate the Words.]</p>
               <p>We will place here a matter of Fact, which we had determined to have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with long ſince, but could not find a convenient place for it. And eye-witneſs hath ſent us the Relation of the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49990:186"/>of one called Monſieur <hi>Charpentier,</hi> of the Village of <hi>Rufac</hi> in <hi>Angoulmois,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of Torments about the time that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was revoked. We ſhall paſs by the ordinary Violences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Dragoons on the Goods of this poor Man. Theſe miſchievous Villains fell on his Perſon, they lighted up many Candles, and cauſed him to dance round about them, until he had loſt both Senſe and Breath. They hindred him from ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which having heated his Blood, put him into a malignant Fever; the Dragoons ſeeing him in this condition, forſook him, and he was carried from his own Houſe to that of one of his Relations. When he was there the Dragoons of <hi>Pinſone</hi> came to <hi>Rufac;</hi> they ſoon learn'd the Houſe where the ſick Man was; thither they went, and at firſt contented themſelves to keep guard about his Bed, offering him a thouſand Outrages, accompanied with Threatning and Blaſphemies. At laſt, ſeeing this did not ſhake him, they cauſed him to drink down twenty great Glaſſes of Water; and his Daughters drank as many more to excuſe their Father. This prevailing nothing as yet, they cauſed melted Greaſe to drop down upon his Eyes for a whole Night to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. He loſt his Sight, and his Eyes
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49990:187"/>never opened more. He loſt his Life alſo, and died in thoſe Torments without the leaſt appearance of Weakneſs, confeſſing the Truth couragiouſly to his laſt Breath.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Christ.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN our preceeding Letter, we have confeſſed to your Converters, that the Invocation of Saints began to be practiſed about the end of the Fourth Age, and in the Fifth. But we have offered to you three Proofs, that that Worſhip was New. Behold a Fourth proof, of the Novelty thereof; 'tis, that in the Fourth and Fifth Ages nothing was known concerning the Invocation of the Bleſſed Virgin. We know what difference Popery puts at this day, between the bleſſed Virgin, and other Saints. She is vaſtly preferred before them; her Worſhip is called <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> and the Worſhip of others ſimple <hi>dulia.</hi> For one Prayer addreſſed to other Saints, there are a hundred to the bleſſed Virgin: where St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath one worſhipper, ſhe hath a hundred. The Titles which are given to the holy Virgin are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more pompous and great than thoſe
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49990:188"/>which are given to the greateſt Apoſtles. And there is ſome reaſon for it. For ſurely the Mother of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ought to have greater Priviledges than his Servants. If then the Invocation of Saints be an Apoſtolick Tradition, we ought to Invocate the holy Virgin Mother of God in the firſt place, and as the Head of our He and She Mediators of the ſecond Order. The Second Age ought to have known this Worſhip, or if any politick reaſon had hindred the Invocation of Saints from manifeſting itſelf in the Third Age; certainly the Invocation of the Virgin ought to have appeared in the front of the Fourth Age amongſt others, like the Sun among the Stars. What folly, what a humour was it then to Invoke St. <hi>Mamas,</hi> St. <hi>Julitta,</hi> and forty Soldiers which ſuffered Martyrdom in the beginning of the Fourth Age, and not to Invoke the Virgin Mother of God.</p>
            <p>As to matter of fact, we do maintain, that the bleſſed Virgin was not prayed unto, till near 100 Years after the firſt birth of that Worſhip. And you may, my Brethren, boldly defie your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters on that ſubject. Whil'ſt there were Churches conſecrated to <hi>St. Stephen, St. Mamas, St. Julitta,</hi> to the forty Soldiers, to <hi>St. Gervais, St. Protais;</hi> and many others which they ſhew unto you, there was not ſo much as a little Chappel for our Lady. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was then ſpoken of but Miracles done by the Martyrs: Mothers deſired of them the recovery of their Husbands, and of their Children, the blind went to them to recover their ſight, and the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick to be reſtored to ſtrength and ſoundneſs, they took them for Protectors in their Voyages. And as a mark of the acknowledgment of the miraculous Deliverances they had received from them, they inriched their Churches with precious and invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Treaſures. This we learn from <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:49990:188"/>writ about the Year 450. And all this while, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſaid of the Miracles of the Virgin, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs afterwards wrought many more than all the other he and ſhe Saints together, except only that <hi>Zozomen</hi> ſays by the by, that about the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak, it was believed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the Virgin appeared there; and wrought Miracles in the Church of the Reſurrection, called <hi>Anaſtaſia.</hi> But he does not ſay, that they prayed unto her in that Church. The Martyrs had not only their Churches, but they had alſo their Feaſts in the Third Age, in which mention was made of their grievous ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Virgin had then no Feaſts. At this day ſhe has ſeven, but the moſt ancient of them is not above 800 or 900 years old. 'Tis true, that that which at this day is called <hi>Candlemas,</hi> which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Hypapante,</hi> is more ancient. But at the beginning it was celebrated in the honour of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and not of the Virgin. 'Twas the Preſentation of Jeſus Chriſt in the Temple, and not the Purification of the Virgin. It was called <hi>Hypapante,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>meeting,</hi> becauſe of the meeting of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> the Propheteſs who went before the Child, and both concurred to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie concerning the Wonders of this new-born Infant. To conclude, that which is found moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Invocation of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is what <hi>Nicephorus Caliſtus</hi> ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 15. c. 28.</note> concerning it; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Peter Cnaphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the falſe Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> an intruding <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heretick did of his own head mention the Mother of God in all his Prayers, and invoke her Divine Name. This was about the Year 470, or 480. Behold a great reputation for the religious Worſhip of the Virgin to be invented by an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick. This unadviſed Zeal for the Virgin began upon occaſion of the <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Hereſie, who affirmed
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:49990:189"/>a Humane Perſon in Chriſt Jeſus, as well as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and for that reaſon did not think fit that the Virgin ſhould be called the Mother of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had not been made uſe of for any thing elſe, but to conceive in her Womb the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Perſon of our Saviour. To oppoſe this, men fell into other exceſſes, they began to give to the Virgin great and magnificent Titles. But Invocation and Worſhip of her came not ſo ſoon. 'Tis true, 'twas the firſt original of her adoration. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was raſh without doubt, and God forbid that we ſhould ever be of his Opinion, if he did indeed put two perſons in Chriſt Jeſus, as well as two Natures. Neither do we deny, that the Holy Virgin may in a good sence be called the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> ſeeing ſhe is the Mother of Jeſus Chriſt, who is God. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, it was an unhappy raſhneſs in the Doctors of the Fifth Age, to innovate in the terms. The Virgin is not called the <hi>Mother of God</hi> any where in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but only the Mother of Jeſus, and we ought to have kept there. This Name, the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> hath ſomething which ſounds ill, and is oppoſite to the <hi>Idea</hi> of God, who can have no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Moreover, God did not pour out his bleſſing upon the falſe Wiſdom of theſe Doctors. On the contrary he hath permitted, that the moſt criminal and exceſſive of all the Idolatries of Antichriſtianiſm ſhould take its original from thence. <hi>Theodorus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> tells us of a Temple of the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 2.</note>; In which the Patriarch <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> appointed Prayers for the day of preparation. But this was under the Empire of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius,</hi> at the end of the Fifth Age. If they quote to you Authors of the Fourth Age, and thoſe that did precede it for the Invocation of the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, maintain boldly to them, that they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious Pieces, and we are ready to prove
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49990:189"/>it by the Teſtimonies of our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> hath lately taken a great deal of pains, to find Teſtimonies in the Ancients for the Invocation of the Virgin before the Sixth Age. But altho' all his Book be a declared war againſt good ſence and honeſty, nevertheleſs there is not any ſubject in which he hath bid greater defiance to the one and the other than on this. He quotes to us two Epiſtles of <hi>St. Ignatius</hi> in the Firſt Age, the one to <hi>St. John,</hi> the other to the <hi>Virgin;</hi> two ſottiſh Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are acknowledged ſuppoſititious by the learned of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as well as by thoſe of our own. And yet what is there in thoſe two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? No religious Invocation, but only ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Praiſes, and a Prayer to the Virgin, who was yet living, that ſhe would fortifie the New Converts in the Faith. He produces <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> another falſe Work, and which ſome Impoſtor did forge under the Name of this Saint, more than 400 Years after his death. And yet there is no Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Virgin found there, but only exceſſive Elogies and Praiſes. In the Second Age he quotes under the Name of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> a Book of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Anſwers to the Orthodox. He muſt have as little Judgment as this Jeſuit, to quote under the Name of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> a Work where the Author ſpeaks of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and of <hi>Origen,</hi> who writ almoſt of hundred Years after the death of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> Moreover, they quote nothing from this Book to which we cannot ſubſcribe, for 'tis an explication of the juſt Honour, which is due to the Virgin, exactly according to our apprehenſions and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> could quote nothing more to his own diſadvantage. This Jeſuit, who heaps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the Impertinencies of thoſe which went before him, could not forbear to imitate the falſhood
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49990:190"/>of thoſe who quoted thoſe words of <hi>Ireneus; That the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>was the Advocate of the Virgin</hi> Eve. As if <hi>St. Ireneus</hi> intended to ſay, that <hi>Mary</hi> prays and interceeds at this day in the Heavens for the ſins of <hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of all men. But theſe Gentlemen have been advertiſed a long time ſince, that the word whereof <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſerves himſelf in the <hi>Greek,</hi> which is loſt, is <hi>Paraclete,</hi> which ſignifies rather a <hi>Comforter</hi> than an <hi>Advocate;</hi> His meaning is, that <hi>Mary</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Mother to the Saviour of the World, hath comforted <hi>Eve</hi> concerning the evil which ſhe did by deſtroying Mankind. And Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious, that in the ſame place, he quotes from the ſame <hi>Ireneus</hi> another paſſage, which ruins the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he would drawn from the firſt. 'Tis a paſſage where <hi>St. Ireneus</hi> ſays<note n="*" place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 3.</note>, Eve <hi>by her diſobedience, was the cauſe that ſhe herſelf and all mankind have been ſubject to death. But the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>by her obedience, was the cauſe of her own ſalvation, and that of all mankind.</hi> By her obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the faith which ſhe gave to the words of the Angel, by which faith the Lord was conceived in her Womb. Behold now this Ancient underſtands, that <hi>Mary</hi> was the Comforter and the Advocate of <hi>Eve.</hi> In the Third Age he quotes a paſſage of <hi>Origen,</hi> (<hi>Homily the</hi> 1st, <hi>in Matt.</hi>) which ſays nothing which we don't ſay every day touching the purity of the Virgin. In the ſame Age he quotes under the Name of <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neoceſarea,</hi> called <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus,</hi> three Sermons on the <hi>Feast of the Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But this man knows not that the <hi>Feast of the Annunciation</hi> was unknown in the Third Age in which <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neoceſarea</hi> lived; how could he make Sermons on that Feaſt? And how could there be a Feaſt in that Age to the memory of the <hi>Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> when there was none as yet to the honour of our Lord and Saviour's Birth? <hi>St. Chryſoſtom</hi> learns
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49990:190"/>us, that it was in his time, <hi>i. e.</hi> about the end of the Fourth Age, that men began to celebrate this latter Feaſt. That which he reports from <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Dioniſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is nothing to purpoſe. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports in this Third Age, a paſſage attributed to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> who ſuffered Martyrdom un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> but this Sermon belongs not to him, nor to any other contemporary Author. For there are Impertinencies therein which we cannot aſcribe to a wiſe man; as this which he ſays, <hi>that God is deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Virgin, and that God who hath ſaid, Honour thy Father and thy Mother, ought himſelf to obſerve the Commandment which he hath given to others.</hi> In the Fourth Age he quotes <hi>St. Athanaſius, St. Ephraim, St. Jerom, St. Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> Sermons or Works that are none of theirs: and a man needs but indifferent Learning and little Sincerity to be convinced thereof. But Father <hi>Craſſet,</hi> who has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other, neither Skill nor Science, takes and gives all for good. In the Fifth Age he quotes <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who is ſurely one of the firſt which gave occaſion to the Religious Worſhip of the Virgin. For by oppoſing <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who would not ſuffer <hi>Mary</hi> to be called the Mother of God, he paſſed unto the other extreme, and advanced as far and as high as he could the praiſes of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Nevertheleſs this might be reduced to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophes, Figures of Oratory, and great Elogies; but there is nothing of Invocation therein. No Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Fifth Age ſpeaks more expreſly nor vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently of the Invocation of Martyrs, and of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is given to the Reliques than <hi>Theodoret.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in the paſſage which Father <hi>Craſſet</hi> quotes from him in his Commentary, on the words of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Song, <hi>My beloved is one,</hi> there is nothing that favours the Worſhip of the Virgin in the leaſt. He applies theſe words, <hi>My Dove, my only one,</hi> to the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49990:191"/>Virgin, and that were the place to ſpeak of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which ought to be given to her, if ever there were any. But all that he ſays concerning her is, that ſhe is the <hi>Mother of God, a pure Virgin, that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions call her bleſſed, that ſhe is the Dove, and the only one which brought Christ Jeſus into the World, that in Charity ſhe ſurpaſſes the Cherubims and Seraphims.</hi> That were the place to have ſaid, that we ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ourſelves to her Charity, and invoke her as our Mediatrix. To conclude, let theſe Gentlemen find us in the Fourth and Fifth Ages, Chappels and Oratories conſecrated to the Virgin, as they find them conſecrated to the Martyrs, unleſs it be about the end of the Fifth age. Now this being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I dare ſay, that a man muſt have renounced all honour, all modeſty, all ſincerity, and all judgment, not to confeſs that here is an indubitable evidence, that Invocation of Saints was a Novelty in the Fourth and Fifth Ages. For theſe men had been fools not to have invoked the Virgin in thoſe times when they invoked <hi>St. Protais,</hi> and <hi>St. Gervais,</hi> if they eſtabliſhed Invocation upon the merit, the dignity, and the reputation that theſe Saints might have with God. I would fain know if thoſe two Giants which ſuffered Martyrdom under <hi>Decius,</hi> were in condition to intercede with God with ſo much efficacy as this Virgin-Mother to the Saviour of the World? This falſe Worſhip had its birth from that fooliſh love which men had for Reliques. And as they had no Reliques of the bleſſed Virgin, ſo they conſecrated no Churches or Chappels to her, and in conſequence thereof, they did not call upon her. We ſhall bring you yet in what follows new Proofs of the Novelty of this Worſhip.</p>

               <head>An Article of Controverſie: A Continuation of the Anſwer to the Illuſions of the New Converts.</head>
               <p>LEt us take up again, at preſent, what follows of the Illuſions, which the New Converts make for themſelves, who endeavour to lay their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences aſleep: <hi>They conclude two things,</hi> 1. <hi>That all the fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity, being Confeſſed by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>they are obliged to remain with her,</hi> ſo you go on. Theſe fundamental Truths which <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hath preſerved, are the Articles of the <hi>Three Creeds,</hi> that of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that of <hi>Niece,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and that which is call'd by the name of St. <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath retained theſe; but to conceive how you cheat yourſelves, I intreat you to ſuppoſe Chriſtians which receive theſe three Creeds, and who nevertheleſs Adore the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, and almoſt all the Idols of Paganiſm; you will ſay that theſe things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent. But you deceive yourſelves: for there is nothing more poſſible, than that, that a man ſhould believe God is the Creatour of Heaven and Earth, that Jeſus Chriſt is his eternal Son, and the Creatour of the World, that he was Born, that he Died, that he was Crucified, that he will come to Raiſe and Judge the Living and the Dead; and nevertheleſs, that he ſhould believe that we may A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Earth, the Trees, the Sun and Moon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God does animate and fill them. The Greed ſays not, that we muſt Worſhip none but God, yea, it ſays not that we muſt Worſhip him. So that a Religion may receive the Creed in good earneſt, in the ſence of the Univerſal Church, and adore every thing but God: Why may not men be capable of Adoring the Stars, becauſe God fills them, ſince they Adore Bread under a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Jeſus Chriſt is there, after a manner invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49990:192"/>preciſely as God is in the Stars and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? It is therefore, a particular Providence, that Chriſtians, who Adore the Euchariſt, are not fallen ſo far as to Adore the Sun, Moon, and Stars; for I do maintain, that the Papiſts may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Adore a Stone, as naturally as they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Adore the Bread in the Euchariſt, on ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that Jeſus Chriſt is included under it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you, that they were come ſo far, would you yet ſay, <hi>Since all the fundamental Truths are Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this Communion, which Adore the Sun and Moon, yea, Stones, we are obliged to continue with it?</hi> Learn you therefore, that we may retain the fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity, and build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Dung, Poiſon, and all ſorts of Impurities: The ſpirit of Man is capable of reconciling thoſe things that are molt irreconcileable.</p>
               <p>Behold another thing, whereof you ought to be advertiſed, that you ought to diſtinguiſh <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truths</hi> from <hi>fundamental Errours:</hi> You imagine, that to retain all the <hi>fundamental Truths,</hi> and to have no <hi>fundamental Errours,</hi> is the ſame thing; and becauſe we do confeſs the Roman Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the <hi>fundamental Truths,</hi> you think, that we confeſs to you, that ſhe has no <hi>fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi> In this you are much miſtaken: a perſon may retain the <hi>fundamental Truths</hi> of Chriſtianity, and add thereunto <hi>fundamental Errours.</hi> I gave you an Example in men who might believe the Creed in good earneſt, in the ſence of the Church, and which might add (under a hundred falſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Devotion) Pagan Idolatries. I do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a man may adopt into the Religion of Chriſtians, almoſt all the Abominations of the <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes</hi> of <hi>Japan,</hi> and the <hi>Brachmns</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> without any formal Renunciation of the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith. I demand, if whilſt men retain
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49990:192"/>the <hi>fundamental Truths,</hi> they do not add <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errours</hi> by eſpouſing theſe Pagan Worſhip? 'Tis exactly that which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has done: upon the Foundations of Chriſtianity, ſhe hath built a thouſand Superſtitions, which are purely Pagan: Popery is Paganiſm renewed, and built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſtianity; 'tis an Idol Temple raiſed upon the Temple of Jeſus Christ. A fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is therefore an Errour or Practice which in itſelf is inconſiſtent with the Foundation.</p>
               <p>I ſay, in itſelf, and by itſelf; for men find ways of reconciling all things, Impiety and Religion, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Superſtition: But we may not conclude, That all that which men do joyn together, is in itſelf reconcileable, and compatible. The <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath a hundred Errours and Practices of this ſort: her Worſhip of Saints, Images, Reliques, and of the Sacrament, is not by any means recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with the Worſhip of the true God, and with true Faith in Christ Jeſus.</p>
               <p>There is yet a third Advice which I have to give you, on this ſubject, 'tis that to be able to ſay as you do, That the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> confeſſes all fundamental Truths: 'Tis neceſſary not only that ſhe hold the fundamental Truths of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, but alſo thoſe of Natural Religion. 'Tis a Fundamental of Natural Religion, that we ought to Worſhip God; the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> retains this Fundamental. 'Tis another Fundamental of Natural Religion, that there is but one God, and that we muſt Worſhip none but him; Popery has ruined and rejected this Fundamental, for it A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores a many other things beſide God: So that to ſpeak properly, we cannot ſay, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> retains all Fundamentals. We might yet obſerve other Fundamentals, which flue receives not. Don't flatter yourſelves therefore, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49990:193"/>any more by this wicked Illuſion, <hi>The</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church confeſſes all fundamental Truths, therefore we may continue there in ſafety:</hi> For that reaſoning is no better than this, <hi>This Wine retains all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the ſtrength, the taſt, and the ſpirits of Wine, therefore we may drink of it, with ſafety, though it be mingled with Poiſon.</hi> Idolatry, Errours, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition take away from the Doctrines of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all that which is ſaving in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are obliged to continue in Union with the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, rather than make a poſitive Separation, which is contrary to all the Duties of Charity, and which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing back thoſe which Err, produces nothing but an eternal Diſtance and Animoſity.</hi> This is that which your Apologiſt ſays, concerning which you ought to know, That Chriſtian Truths are Friends, and do not deſire that we ſhould ſacrifice one for the other: We muſt not ſacrifice Faith and Truth for Charity. 'Tis a falſe Charity which makes thoſe that are re-united to the Church, ſpeak thus; 'tis indeed ſelf-love, and the love of eaſe: If they could find means to caſt off the Popiſh Superſtitions, which are uneaſie to them, from Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to their own Advantages, it is ſure that they would do it, without having any regard to Charity, and without concerning themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſcandal of Separation, and the trouble of their Country-men. For which reaſon, while the King permitted every one to live peaceably, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering Violence to his Conſcience, Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not appear ſcandalous unto them. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, my Brethren, to know, and examine yourſelves thereon; do not ſuffer the Devil and Self-love to illude you, and diſguiſe himſelf into Charity, and an Angel of Light. Charity demands Toleration; I confeſs it, but it hath its bounds: For it is not expedient that you imagine, that we
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:49990:193"/>ought to ſuffer all things under pretence of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Popery is Anti-chriſtianity; you can't doubt it, without blinding yourſelves; Popery hath fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errours; to conclude, Popery hath ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Efficacy of thoſe fundamental Truths which it hath preſerved, and by conſequence is in no condition to require or expect Toleration. <hi>Inſtead of bringing back thoſe that Err, Schiſm produces, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an eternal Diſtance and Animoſity,</hi> ſay you: Do you think that this lead Complaiſance, which you are willing to have for thoſe that Err, is capable of reducing them? Will you not confirm them in their Errours, by living with them, communicating with them, and by partaking in their falſe Myſteries? But let us hear what you have farther to ſay to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſecond place,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we do maintain, That perſons do not neceſſarily partake in the Errours of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in which they are:</hi> This is that you told us in the beginning of this Writing. <hi>Abuſes introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Governours, cannot be imputed to the Faithful.</hi> You add, <hi>The common Confeſſion of Faith ought to be eſteemed as an Agreement to live together under the ſame Miniſtery; but we are not therefore, accountable for all the Abuſes which may be, or can be introduced into this Mniſtery.</hi> My Brethren, this ſecond thing which you tell yourſelves, and one another, is no better than the former: Where have you found <hi>that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes introduced by Governours, may not be imputed to the Faithful?</hi> Do you not very well know, That there are no Abuſes in the Church, which have not been introduced either by the Malice, or by the Ignorance of Governours? They are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Teachers which frame Hereſies: Were not thoſe private perſons ſeduced by <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> culpable, becauſe that Hereſie was introduced by the Biſhops? Are you obliged to follow your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours without examination. Have you not a
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49990:194"/>reaſonable Mind as well as we? And ought you not to make a good uſe of it? And if you fail therein, do you think that God will fail to take an account of you for it? If we mull give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Abuſes introduced by Governours, when the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced by a falſe Paſtor, to commit Idolatry, were they not therefore culpable? Nevertheleſs, you ſee how God, on ſuch occaſions, thunders againſt both People and Governours, <hi>When the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch,</hi> ſaith our Lord. He did very ill to ſpeak ſo, according to your Principles; there was no body but the firſt blind man, that lead the way, who ought to fall into the Ditch. Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, <hi>You compaſs ſea and land, to make a Proſelite; and when you have gained him, you make him twofold more the child of hell, than yourſelf.</hi> And why ſo? why doth this poor Proſelite become a-Child of Hell, ſince he follows his Governours, yea, Governours which had a lawful Call, and were Paſtors of the Church? If Truth be the only way to Heaven, it concerns you much how you go out of it, be it of your own inclination, or by the inſtigation of another, you will always fill ſhort of Heaven: Whether you go to Hell, or whether another leads you thither, what difference will it make, will you not be certainly there? Diſcharge yourſelves therefore, of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Chimera, That you are not at all account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Abuſes introduced by your Guides.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <hi>Me do not partake, neceſſarily, in the Errours of a Communion where we are.</hi> How do you underſtand that, whilſt you ſubſcribe theſe Errours, and practiſe theſe Idolatries? There are Errours of Speculation, and Errours of Practice; the means of not partaking in Errours of Speculation, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly to diſavow them, without Scruple or Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49990:194"/>The means of not partaking in Errours of Practiſe, which are Superſtitions and Idolatries, is, to abſtain from them, give no conſent to them, not aſſiſt at them, but condemn and call them by their own names: If you can continue in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, doing thus, I conſent unto it; ſay, without Scruple and Heſitation, That the corporal and real Preſence is a Dream, Tranſubſtantiation a Monſter, Purgatory a Fable, Humane Merits and Satisfactions Doctrines of Pride, the Maſs a Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Miſteries, the Worſhip of Bread, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Saints, and the Adoration of Images Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries: be never preſent at the Maſs, never Adore the Bread, never be found at thoſe Veſpers and Martins where they call upon Creatures; retract the Subſcriptions you have given to Lies, and after that, ſtay, if you can, in the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi> But you call it no participation in the Errours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, to ſubſcribe them, as you have done without believing them; to aſſiſt, or be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Maſs, accounting it a vain pomp of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; to proſtrate yourſelves before the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, believing, nevertheleſs, that 'tis but Bread; to communicate under One Kind, retaining an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in your Heart, that they do you wrong, to take away the Cup; to aſſiſt at Veſpers and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, at Proceſſions where they bear Images and Relicques in pomp, and where they give Religious Worſhip to Creatures, in the mean while believing theſe are Superſtitions, whereof it were well to diſcharge Religion: Behold, ſay I, that which you call <hi>not to partake in the Errours of a Communion where we are;</hi> and this is that, which I call, (and all thoſe that are wiſe, with me) to partake in them after the leudeſt manner in the World, and that which, is moſt criminal, and capable of ruining you. Be aſſured, that theſe poor Biggots, which
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49990:195"/>are perpetually kiſſing their Images, and who know no other God, but their Patron Saint, are in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtate than you; for they partake honeſtly in Errours and Superſtitions, but you partake in them againſt your Conſcience.</p>

The fear, which the Prelates aſſembled in the Country of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and the Dragoons (a People at this day of the ſame Order) have put the minds of men into, has forced the most part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Niſmes</hi> and <hi>Cevennes,</hi> to conſent to all that they have demanded of them: but by ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as gives horrour and amazement to thoſe that have done it, and to all that hear thereof: For theſe ſpeak and unhappy People have proceeded ſo far, as to make Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, in which they beſeech the King, to Chaſtiſe them with the ſeverest Rods, if they fail to perform all the Duty of good Catholicks. We may judge how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere they were therein, by all that hath been ſeen ſince that time: They did not ceaſe to aſſemble on the Feaſtivals of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> last, in great numbers in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and their hearts not being able to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Promiſes, which their mouths and hands had made, they have acquitted themſelves of thoſe Duties of good Catholicks, leſs than ever; ſo that the Rage of 'their Perſecutors is grown to its height. The Intendant
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:49990:195"/>Mr. <hi>de Baville,</hi> cauſed five or ſix of thoſe which were impriſoned for being found at their last Aſſembly, to be hanged, and ſent to the Gallies: He cauſed theſe ſix to draw Lots, that he might hang but two of them.

Mr. <hi>Barbutt</hi> exerciſed, to the utmost, all the Patience, and all the Art of the Jeſuits, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to his Death: He ſpake the most Edifying things in the World; and did not teſtifie leſs of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Greatneſs of Mind, than the Illuſtrious Mr. <hi>de Rey</hi> had lately done, who died at <hi>Beaucaire:</hi> When they ſaw they could gain nothing upon theſe two Martyrs, they cauſed a Drum to be beaten at the foot of the Gibbet, that no body might hear the edifying Diſcourſes which proceeded out of their mouths. Since this time, they have made two Martyrs at <hi>Ledignan;</hi> in the ſame Province of <hi>Languedoc:</hi> One of them is named <hi>Meyrien,</hi> and the other <hi>Satindſe;</hi> this lag never changed his Religion, nor made any Subſcription.

                     <p>To overcome the Conſtancy of thoſe who have reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Priſons, Gallies, Dungeons, Hunger, Thirst, Vermin, and Rottonneſs, they have thought of a new kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, in the Council of Perſecutors, and 'tis to ſend our Faithful Brethren to <hi>Canada:</hi> They conduct them in Troops to <hi>Marſeille,</hi> and to <hi>Caſteldy,</hi> where they must be embarqued. In one Month's time they have drawn from the Priſons of <hi>Mempellier,</hi> of <hi>Aygues-Mortes,</hi> of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> and of all the parts of <hi>Ceuennes,</hi>
                        <pb n="370" facs="tcp:49990:196"/>a number of Priſoners ſo great, that we know not how to count them, for fear of ſpeaking it too little, or of not being believed, for reporting it too much: This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Letters which have been written, more than ſix Weeks or two Months ſince, do ſay, that there are already <hi>400</hi> Priſoners at the least, which have been embarqued at <hi>Marſeille,</hi> or are ready for it, to be led into Slavery in thoſe new Countries.</p>
                     <p>It is expedient, that you ſee here ſome extracts of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that came from that Country: One Letter from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſays, That a great number of Men hath been ſeen to paſs with their legs tyed under the bellies of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, followed by twelve long Carts, covered over, and filled with Men and Women, tied by the waſtes to the Carts: Theſe are perſons of <hi>Upper Languedoc,</hi> which were carried to <hi>Marſeille,</hi> to be ſent into <hi>America.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe perſons there were ſome very famous: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, an Advocate of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> who is famous by a Confeſſion of eighteen Months, which he paſſed in a dark.

A more glorious Teſtimany cannot be given to the Courage, Piety, Conſtancy, and Zeal of a Confeſſour, than is with one conſent given to this man; Behold him at preſent going to carry the Torch of his Faith into another World: and I hope that it will kindle other Torches there. There are alſo Mr. <hi>Guirant</hi> and Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> both of <hi>Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> which are not leſs Illuſtrious for their Perſeverance and their Piety, having never made any Defection from the Faith. Mr. <hi>Serre,</hi> of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> Mr. <hi>Guy,</hi> of <hi>Bederieux,</hi> a Widdow named Madam <hi>de Boſc,</hi> and her Siſter, Mademoiſelle <hi>de Cavaille,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> alſo of <hi>Mompellier,</hi> two Siſters of Mr. <hi>Anauld,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Vaunert,</hi> are alſo of this number. There are alſo Gentlemen and Perſons of Quality, which we will not name unto you, until we are perfectly aſſured
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49990:196"/>thereof. Behold, a Letter from one of theſe honest Men, which will acquaint you with the diſpoſition of Mind in which they are, on the Subject, and in the proſpect of this new kind of Puniſhment.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>I Have thought (my dear Mother) that before I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into another World, as they threaten us, it is my Duty, to inform you of my State, and to acquaint you with the true ſentiments of my Soul: Oh how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are you, and my dear Siſters, whom GOD, by his infinite Mercy, hath preſerved ſo long in your Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and preſerved from the Snares that have been ſo often laid for you, but more eſpecially in that he hath led you in ſo miraculous a manner out of this ſad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Kingdom, that you may taſte his Divine Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in Holy Aſſemblies, with all the liberty that can be deſired. Be never forgetful of Benefits ſo great, if you do deſire that GOD ſhould continue his Belſſings and Mercies upon you, and yours: Pray continually for the Liberty of <hi>Zion;</hi> for all our poor Brethren that have unhappily fallen; and for the Priſoners of Jeſus Christ. You have begun gloriouſly, but all that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if you don't perſevere to the end; therefore give up yourſelves to Divine Providence, and be aſſured that God will give you, all that is neceſſary in this life, and that which is to come, if ſo be you offer unto him that acceptable Sacrifice of your Goods, your Families, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of your Lives: Never turn your face back again through Trouble, and regret for what you have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; don't do as the Wife of <hi>Lot,</hi> least you partake in the ſame Puniſhment. I do acknowledge, that there is need of extraordinary Endeavours, and very great Grace to ſurmount our Natural Affections; and that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Natural Compaſſion which does ſo ſtrongly bind
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49990:197"/>us to eath other, but when the Glory of God, and our own Salvation is diſcourſed, on, we ought not to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger one moment from following our Duty; for he which loves Fathor or Mother, Husband, Wife or Children more than his Saviour, is not worthy to be called his Diſciple: Wherefore, my dear Mother and Siſters, make appear to your last breath, the difference you make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Earth and Heaven, betwixt the perfect love which we have for our Divine Redeemer, and that which we have for the things of the World; and let us aſſure ourſelves of his Protection and Favour, if we perſevere to the end. The death of my Father hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly edified and comforted me, his Patience and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance hath given a joyful and certain Aſſurance of his Happineſs; that 'tis ſo far from afflicting me, that I deſire to be diſſolved, as he is, to be with Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which is much better: I reſerve my Tears for the ſad and deplorable State of the Church, and for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hard-hartedneſs of my poor Brethren, for whom I pray unto God night and day, that he would cauſe them to return from their wandrings, and ſhew them Mercy and Grace: This is that true Affliction which eats up my Soul, and ſadly overwhelms my Spirit; for my own part, I was never more content, and at rest, than I find myſelf at preſent: So that after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conſidered the World, and all its Vanities, I eſteem (with St. <hi>Paul</hi>) that all things duely reckoned, the Sufferings of the preſent World are not worthy to be <hi>compared</hi> with the <hi>Glory that ſhall be Revealed.</hi> So that, my dear Mother, I am fully reſolved to do my Duty, even to my last moment: They have already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Marſeille</hi> a hundred Priſoners; and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of this Month, we, being Seventy in number, departed from <hi>Montpellier</hi> thither. They have brought from <hi>Sommieres</hi> twenty four Maids, or Wives, and to morrow they bring forty more from thence: 'tis the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Randevouze. I know not what will be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>event
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:49990:197"/>of all this; nevertheleſs, all are perfectly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for this long Voyage. Monſieur de <hi>Croſs</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways here, who is ſhortly to be embarqued with his own Daughters, and four of Monſieur <hi>Audemard</hi>'s, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver changed their Religion. Whatever be our fate, we ſhall always be under the Eyes of God, and his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Pray for us, as we do for you; and let all our Friends, and all your Churches redouble their Prayers for thoſe poor unhappy Perſons which are carried away, it may be to the Shambles. God be with you, my dear Mother, and dear Siſters; be aſſured, that I ſhall be Faithful to my God, to my laſt breath, in whatſoever place I ſhall remain.</p>
                     <p>This laſt kind of Puniſhment has ſtricken men with more horrour than all the preceding; whilſt perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their Country, they endure the labours of flight, the uneaſineſs of ſojourning in Woods, Famine, Thirſt, Priſon and the Gallies, in ſome hopes of change, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations; but to ſee their Entrails torn from their boſoms, the half of ones ſelf, a Wife, a Husband, Children unmercifully forced into another World, expoſed to the rage of the Sea, to the dangers of a long Voiage, and at the end of all, to a cruel Slavery upon barbarous or unknown Shores, where they live without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which thoſe that are their own, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in the Rigours of a very calamitous Servitude: This is the new kind of Puniſhment, ſay I, which puts the Patience of the moſt Confirmed to a period. But nothing does more diſcover the temper of the Devil of Perſecution: It does not ſuffice to lay waſte the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom after a hundred manners, to put to flight an infinite number of Men, and to make Wilderneſſes of Countries heretofore well Peopled, they will Depopulate the State, and Tranſport the beſt of its Inhabitants into barbarous Countries. Poor Slaves remember, that God is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that the Gates of Heaven are open in all places: Be you perſwaded, that <hi>Canada</hi> will rejoyce
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:49990:198"/>to ſee your Conſtancy, and that the Voice of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion will paſs the Seas, and come even to us; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, that it will pierce the Heavens, and arrive e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the Throne of God, where you will find favour, and it may be your Enemies will find diſpleaſure, and wrath, for the Voice of your Suffering will ſollicite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, and haſten their Puniſhment: the Lord have pitty on them, and convert them; they ought to be the Objects of our Compaſſion, rather than thoſe of our Wrath. Whilſt they emptie the Cittadels on one ſide, they fill them on the other. A Letter written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                        </gap> Country of <hi>Caſtres</hi> to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> more than five hundred Priſoners, who, without doubt, muſt travel into the New Found World, as well as others. How ſad ſoever the lot of theſe poor People, that are carried into another World, may ſeem, I reckon it more eaſie than the ſtate of thoſe who are in the Priſons of the Province of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where they treat them as cruelly as they can do the worſt of Criminals and Parricides, yea, they inſult over them in a more inſolent manner. It hath been written within a few Months, That one of the Priſoners of <hi>Aigrie-mortes,</hi> having had licenſe to go out of his Dungeon, to take the Air for a few moments, and having delayed to return to it a little longer than a Souldier which ſtood Centinel, thought he ought to have done, immediately he diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Muſquet at him, and killed him upon the place. 'Tis an action like that which, I think, I may have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported elſe-where, concerning one named <hi>Moliere,</hi> a gallant man, and a very good Chriſtian, Priſoner in the ſame Tower of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who was taken thence to aſſiſt at the drawing of one of his Brethren to the Dung-hill, his heart failing him, he fell down, and a Souldier, that was near him, knockt him on the head, without giving him leiſure to return, or recover from his langour and weakneſs. We have alſo Letters, that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49990:198"/>of many Priſoners tranſported from <hi>Niſmes</hi> to <hi>Aigue-mortes,</hi> three finding themſelves very ill, deſired that they might be viſited by Phyſitians, to the end it might be certainly known, that they were not in a condition to undertake the Journey. They laught at them, and on the evening, when they arrived there, they caſt them into a hideous Priſon, where, not being able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much as a little Water, to moderate the Fire which devoured them, they fell into Delivation, and died the day after. And this is exactly that which they deſire, for they don't tire them, by theſe Tranſportations and hideous Priſons, to any other end, but that they may make them die without noiſe, but after a manner more ſad and lamentable, than a death upon a Gibbet, or the Wheel would be: If they excuſe ſome Women, from the Voiage to <hi>Canada,</hi> 'tis to put them into the hands of <hi>Rapine,</hi> the moſt wicked of all the Hang-men, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter to the Biſhop of <hi>Valence:</hi> The Puniſhment to which he expoſes thoſe Women, is to whip them night and day, till the blood come; none hath eſcaped his hands, except one that died in the Dungeon. To the end that the new Converts, whoſe Conſcience is a kind of Hell, may receive no Conſolation by any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which their Brethren, they have eſtabliſhed a new kind of Inquiſition upon Letters: They have not only granted Commiſſion to Perſons at all Poſt-houſes, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Letters, but on the ſixteenth of <hi>February,</hi> they made a general Inquiſition in all the Houſes of the new Catholicks, to find not only perſons that might be hid there, but alſo the Letters which diſcovered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce which they held with thoſe which were gone out of the Kingdom. By this Search, the City was in the ſtate of a place where they were about to make a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre; and indeed all the Inhabitants were under the fears thereof, and every one believed himſelf at the point of Death: for all the quarters of the City, and all the corners of the Streets, were filled with Souldiers and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:49990:199"/>Guards, and men were forbidden upon great Penalties to go out of their Houſes: Thus the Perſecutors tempt the Weak by fear, and the horrours of Death which they ſet before their eyes: this Tragedy ended in the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great number of perſons: To conclude, as the Rage of Perſecutors never went farther, ſo the Fear and Terrour that hath ſeized the minds of Men, was never greater.</p>
                     <p>All the Attempts of our Enemies would be vain, if we had the Spirit of Martyrdom, and Feared God more than Men. This is that (my Brethren) which you muſt endeavour to obtain; and to that end, ſet always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, the great difference that God propoſes and promiſes to thoſe which ſhall ſuffer Martyrdom; we know not how, ſufficiently to expreſs them: Conſider the glorious Rewards that God promiſes in the two firſt Chapters of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the Crowns, the Thrones, the hidden Manna, the new Name, the Rule over Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Iron Scepter to Subdue them, and the White Garments. 'Tis true, that all true Believers will have part in theſe advantages; but 'tis true, nevertheleſs, that 'tis of Martyrs only that God ſpeaks there: and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they ſhall poſſeſs theſe advantages in a degree of pre-eminence above others. <hi>The Peace of GOD be with you all.</hi>

               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you from our God and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is not a Point of Practice in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, concerning the Antiquity whereof your Converters make ſo much boaſt, as that of the Invocation of Saints, which they find in the Fifth Age. For which reaſons you ought not to think it ſtrange, that we heap Proof upon Proof, to make it evident to you, that this unhappy Superſtition did not deſcend from the Apoſtles, nor their Succeſſors, but that it had its birth about the end of the Fourth Age. Behold yet a new Mark of the Novelty of this Worſhip. 'Tis, that at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men prayed only to the Martyrs, and not to the other Saints. What is the meaning of this? At this day there is no neceſſity of being a Martyr to obtain a Canonization. There are a hundred and a hundred perſons in the <hi>Popiſh Calendar,</hi> which were no Martyrs. We muſt not do that injury to the Church, to believe that ſhe hath had no perſons of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:49990:200"/>eminent Sanctity, except ſuch as have ſuffered Martyrdom. The Principles upon which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints is eſtabliſhed, are, That the Faithful ſee God; that in him they can know all our needs and wants, and underſtand and hear our Prayers; and that being near to God, they can intercede for us. Now theſe Principles ought to eſtabliſh an Invocation of other Saints, as well as of the Martyrs. There were without doubt, in the four firſt Ages of the Church, many holy perſons, which were not martyred: but they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prayed to any of them, and we deſire your Converters to ſhew us any inſtance thereof.</p>
            <p>'Tis neceſſary that you know, that they did not Invocate even all the Martyrs, they prayed only to thoſe whoſe Reliques they had in poſſeſſion. Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine well all the paſſages which you quote from <hi>St. Baſil, St. Gregory, St. Auſtin, St. Jerrome,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> and you will find that they all generally expreſs this; that they went to the Shrines and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of the Martyrs, (ſo they called the places where they had put the Reliques) that there they performed their Devotions, that they recommended themſelves to the interceſſion of the Martyr, that they expected from him miraculous deliverances. But not one will tell you, that they invocated the Saints in their Cloſets, or in Churches, where their Reliques were not. Now who does not ſee, that this is an extravagance? If the Invocation of Saints be good, why is it not as good in a Cloſet, as in a Church? Why not in a Church where there are no Bones nor Aſhes of a Martyr, as well as in one where they are? But this practice was founded upon a vulgar opinion, that the Souls of Saints were not found, but near their Tombs, and that they loved their Aſhes, as <hi>St. Jerome</hi> tells us. And behold the reaſon why,
<list>
                  <item>1. They did not invocate Angels whilſt
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:49990:200"/>they did invocate Martyrs, 'twas becauſe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints began with that of Reliques, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels having left no Reliques here below, their invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation did not make the ſame progreſs.</item>
                  <item>2. 'Tis for the ſame reaſon that they invocated only Martyrs, and not other Saints, 'twas becauſe they had recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected with care only the bones and aſhes of the Martyrs, and for others they ſuffered them to reſt in their Graves, becauſe their fleſh had not been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Croſs of Chriſt.</item>
                  <item>3. 'Tis the reaſon alſo why they did not invocate all Martyrs, but only thoſe of whom they had Reliques.</item>
                  <item>4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, 'Tis for the ſame reaſon that they began ſo lately to invocate the Virgin.</item>
               </list> They had no Reliques of her, they knew not where her Tomb was; and this was it that gave occaſion to the Fable of the Aſſumption of her Body into Heaven. Her other Reliques, her Shifts, her Slippers, her Girdles, her Vails, her Hair, her Milk, all theſe were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and produced till a long time after. This is a point upon which you will do well to preſs your Converters. Deſire of them, that they will ſhew you in the fourth or fifth Age, thoſe Reliques of the Virgin which are at this day the object of the Piety of the Devote's. Thoſe believers were very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in not ſearching after the Milk of the Virgin, whereof at this day the World is full. And 'tis won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that among the Reliques which gave occaſion to invocate the Martyrs in the fourth and fifth Ages, they did not reckon thoſe old Clothes and Rags which have ſince been put among the precious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables of the Devote's. There was nothing but Aſhes and Bones which did then paſs for true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and ſuch as were worthy of veneration.</p>
            <p>Gather together I intreat you, my Brethren, all theſe things, and make reflection upon them. About the end of the fourth Age men began to invocate
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:49990:201"/>Saints. But
<list>
                  <item>1. They did not invocate all Saints, no not the Apoſtles themſelves.</item>
                  <item>2. They prayed only to the Martyrs, nor did they invocate all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs themſelves, and thoſe which they did invocate, they did not invocate in all places, but only where their Reliques were.</item>
                  <item>3. They did not invocate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who are much more worthy of honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation than the Saints.</item>
                  <item>4. They did not invocate the Virgin, who is above all Saints and Angels.</item>
               </list> Is it not plain, that this was an unformed Worſhip, a Worſhip in its birth, a Worſhip which as yet had no Principles to eſtabliſh it upon, and which had for all its foundation, a popular ſuperſtition for the aſhes of thoſe who had ſuffered Martyrdom?</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, to convince you, that, indeed, this Superſtition was as yet a Religion in its birth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Form, and without Principles, give attention to this which follows: 'tis that this Devotion was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form in its Doctrine, as well as in its Worſhip. All Religious Worſhip is founded in ſome Doctrine. The Worſhip of Saints is eſtabliſhed upon the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they know our Needs, hear our Prayers, and ſee the Face of God, with whom they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede. Now in the fourth and fifth Ages, all men were in doubt concerning theſe things. They knew not whether the Saints did hear the Prayers of Men, yea, or no. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> in his Funeral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Siſter <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> ſpeaks to her, but knew not whether ſhe heard him: <hi>If thou hast any regard,</hi> ſays he to her, <hi>to the Honours that we give thee, if holy Souls receive from God the gift of knowing things, kindly accept our Diſcourſe. St. Ambroſe,</hi> in the Book concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Death of his Brother <hi>Satyrus,</hi> ſays, that God had withdrawn him from the World, to the end that he might not ſee the miſeries of the age, and ſpeaking to him, ſays, <hi>Conſidering the compaſſion which your holy Soul had for thoſe which belonged unto you, if now you know
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:49990:201"/>that</hi> Italy <hi>is oppreſſed by an enemy, ſo near unto it, how will you ſigh, how much grief will you feel by reaſon of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that this ſuppoſes, that the dead know not what is done below. <hi>St. Jerome,</hi> who ſpeaks often of the dead, ſpeaks always of them as not knowing what the living ſuffer. He ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Nepotian, that he ſaw not what was done here, and that we could not ſpeak unto him.</hi> He ſays to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> to comfort her concerning the death of her Father, <hi>that he is happy in that he did not ſee the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Countrey.</hi> We ſee that 'tis Nature that ſpeaks; and <hi>St. Jerome</hi> in theſe paſſages deſerves much more to be believed, than when he tells us, that the Souls of Saints move about their Tombs.</p>
            <p>'Tis a thing very obſervable, that <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> was very unquiet and uncertain in this matter, whereby we diſcover alſo the uncertainty of the Divines of his age. This is ſeen chiefly in the Book which he writ <hi>concerning Care for the Dead. Paulinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> had conſulted him about the Devotion of a Woman, who wiſht that her Son had been buried near the Tomb of <hi>St. Felix</hi> the Martyr, formerly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Nola.</hi> This gave him occaſion to handle the Queſtion, how the Dead knew our Neceſſities. He durſt not deny, that the Martyrs did help and aſſiſt us, becauſe of ſo many Miracles that were done, ſays he, near their Remains. But he doubted very much, whether they heard us, and knew our wants. Afterwards he proceeds beyond doubt, and lays down, and proves plainly and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they do not hear us<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 13. De cura pro mort.</note>. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſays, that Souls may know not all, but part of that which is done here below, either by the report of Angels, or by that of the Dead, or by ſome imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation<note n="†" place="margin">Cap. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p>But at laſt it may be ſeen apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:49990:202"/>that he enclines to believe, that Souls have no knowledge of our Prayers, and that they are Angels which do Miracles in the name of Saints; yea, that altho' the Souls of Saints are ſaid to appear, 'tis not they which return, 'tis the Angels which appear, and ſpeak for them. Behold, I pray you, how unform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and floating this Theology is.</p>
            <p>But there is more than this, in theſe ſame ages, when they prayed to Martyrs at one time, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them at another. They prayed, ſay I; for the Martyrs, and for the Apoſtles, yea, for the bleſſed Virgin; and this is a new Proof of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of this Superſtition. This appears by the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of that time: In that of <hi>St. Chryſoſtom</hi> we read, <hi>We offer to thee this reaſonable Service, for thoſe which rest in the Faith of our Anceſtors, our Fathers, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, the Prophets, the Apoſtles, the Preachers, the Evangeliſts, the Martyrs, the Confeſſors, the Continents, and for all the Spirits which were initiated in the Faith, principally for the most holy immaculate, and bleſſed above all Women, our Lady</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, and always a Virgin.</hi> And in that which is attributed to <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem: O God, have mercy on our Fathers, on our Brethren, which are at rest, whoſe Souls are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto thee, give them repoſe; and remember alſo all the holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, Evangeliſts, and all the Spirits of the Just, which are dead in the Faith, and principally the holy and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, always a Virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be at this day the greateſt of all abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to pray for a dead man, and pray to him at the ſame time. Indeed if he be in a condition of doing us good, if he ſee God, if he be with him, he hath no need of our Prayers. The inconſiſtency of theſe two Worſhips, which nevertheleſs were both uſed at the ſame time, is a demonſtrative proof, that the Invocations of Saints was a Novelty. Prayers
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:49990:202"/>for the Martyrs were found in the ancient Liturgies; out of reſpect to Antiquity they were left there, but the torrent of Novelty added unto them Prayers unto the Martyrs, without taking notice, that theſe latter were inconſiſtent with the former. To conclude, I do maintain, that thoſe who will not give attention to theſe Demonſtrations, which prove the Novelty of the Invocation of Saints in the 4th Age have an inſenſible and ſeared Conſcience, and ſo I think it unprofitable to diſpute any more againſt them.</p>
            <p>I well underſtand, that the New Converts, who are willing to be content with their change, will yet find two Fortifications for their ſecurity. They will ſay, that this Worſhip of Saints was then new, but that it was not evil, and that therefore the Church might introduce it, as a pious Cuſtom, and proper to incline the minds of men towards Devotion. But let theſe Gentlemen have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> in that which follows, will give us occaſion to make it plain to you, that this Worſhip, and this Invocation is <hi>Paganiſm</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, and that it is in nothing better than the Invocation of Angels, and Hero's which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> practiſed in their Devotions: we will make them ſee that 'tis a true Idolatry. The other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is the Antiquity of this Worſhip: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, ſay they, you do confeſs, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints hath more than one thouſand two hundred Years on its head. Does this put you to no troubles? Have you no reſpect for ſo goodly a piece of Antiquity? and how can you believe that God hath left his Church under Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for ſo many Ages? We anſwer, That we cannot have reſpect for Antiquity without Truth; and in this we are of the Religion of St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> We add, That we are not aſtoniſht to ſee an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry ſo aged in the Church, becauſe it hath
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:49990:203"/>been expreſly predicted to us: The Prophet St. <hi>John</hi> calls Idolatrous Chriſtians Pagans; and the Spirit ſaith to him,<note n="*" place="margin">Revel. 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.</note> I have given up the outward Court of the Church to the Pagans, that they may tread it under foot for forty two Months: Theſe are the thouſand two hundred and ſixty Days in which the Woman, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church ought to be hidden, as in a Wilderneſs, for the ſpace of theſe thouſand two hundred and ſixty Days. And the two Prophets which propheſied in Sack-cloth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Truth publiſhed by a ſmall number of Witneſſes, and thoſe under the Croſs ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under the oppreſſion of Idolatry, the ſame number of Days, <hi>i. e.</hi> a thouſand two hundred and ſixty: Now theſe thouſand two hundred and ſixty Days, are ſo many Years, according to the ſtile of the Prophets, who denominate Years by Days. We ſhall have, it may be, in what follows, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to prove it to you. It muſt be therefore, that Idolatry Rule in the Chriſtian Church one thouſand two hundred and ſixty Years. It hath done ſo almoſt for that ſpace of time; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore near its end. But we ought not to be amazed that it hath continued ſo long.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An Article of Controverſie: A Continuation of the Anſwer to the Illuſions that the New Converts put upon themſelves.</head>
               <p>WE take up again the Continuation of the Controverſie, at the place where we left the Illuſions of the New Converts: <hi>The common Faith,</hi> ſay you, <hi>is a kind of Agreement to live under the ſame Miniſtery, without being accountable for all the Abuſes that have ſlipt into the Church.</hi> By this fine reaſoning, we may live in ſafety among the <hi>Turks,</hi>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:49990:203"/>we believe, as they do, that there is one GOD, one Paradiſe, one Hell, and that Jeſus Chriſt is the greateſt Prophet which ever came into the World. <hi>This common Confeſſion of Faith will be an Agreement to live together ſafely under the ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery:</hi> And we will leave to the <hi>Turks</hi> their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Abuſes, and their abſurd and impious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. Believe me, ſuch an Agreement reſembles that of <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> who agreed to deſpiſe and put to death Chriſt Jeſus. When the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery introduces ſmall Corruptions, this may be granted; but when Corruption goes to the heart of Religion, the Agreement ſignifies nothing, and lays no obligation; all is deadly, either by itſelf, or by its neighbourhood or contagion: <hi>Provided that we Adore the ſame God, and Profeſs the ſame Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity, all the reſt is not imputable to private perſons: Above all then, when there is a neceſſity of joyning ourſelves to this firſt Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and when we cannot find any publick Worſhip more pure and edifying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Continuation of your Apology: There are two words therein, <hi>Provided</hi> and <hi>above all,</hi> which deſtroy you: Provided that we profeſs the ſame Fundamentals. I have made it appear alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that this <hi>provided</hi> is inſufficient. You muſt add, Provided that fundamental Errours be not added to the Foundations. Now Popery hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Foundations of Chriſtianity, Tyranny, Superſtition, and in one word, Antichriſtianiſm: So, behold yourſelves thrown out of your Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Provided that.</hi> The <hi>Above all</hi> is no better: <hi>Above all, when there is a neceſſity of joyning ourſelves;</hi> There is no neceſſity of joyning ourſelves to a Communion which we acknowledge corrupt, and defiled in its moſt noble Parts. Do you believe, that thoſe Illuſtrious Confeſſours, which fill the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49990:204"/>Priſons and the Gallies, and whom you yourſelves admire, do you believe, I ſay, according to them, there is a neceſſity of joyning yourſelves to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery? They have found ways of diſpenſing with this neceſſity: But your <hi>neceſſity of joyning yourſelves unto it, comes from the love and adherence that you have for your Eſtates, your Eaſe, and your Lives.</hi> An unhappy Neceſſity, which has not its original in Charity, but in Covetuouſneſs; in the Name of God take heed of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we cannot find any publick Worſhip more pure and more holy.</hi> I anſwer, It is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary to adhere to publick Worſhip, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be: The Martyrs and Confeſſours of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſerved him after a more grateful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, although their Worſhip were not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate but hidden, but covered in the darkneſs of a deep Priſon; although you cannot aſſemble your ſelves to pray unto God with your Brethren, you have your Cloſets, of which you may make Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and your Hearts, of which you may make Sanctuaries and Altars. This neceſſity of Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to publick Worſhip, is another Illuſion made by your love of the World: 'Tis better, ſaith one, that hath written to us, to adhere to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Worſhip, than to live without Religion: What lewd Morality it this! Thoſe ſeven thouſand men which were ſo hidden, that <hi>Elijah</hi> knew nothing of them, had they therefore no Religion, becauſe they did not adhere to the publick Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> which was intermixed with that of the true God? To refuſe to participate in an Idolatrous Worſhip, is to be truely Religious; to adhere to a Worſhip which is known to be full of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Impurities, is to have no Religion at all.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, you come to the example of our
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49990:204"/>Fathers: <hi>The example of our Fathers,</hi> ſay you, <hi>before the Reformation, proves clearly, that we may ſecure our Salvation in the</hi> Roman <hi>Communion, though we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here even to the publick Worſhip: Whatever men ſay, 'tis inconceivable that men born and bred up in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and which never heard any thing ſaid of any other Doctrine, and who lived and died without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt the Doctrines of their Church, ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver partake in the Worſhip thereof.</hi> Would to God you would ſtay yourſelves on the examples of your Fathers, and Grand-fathers, without aſcending ſo high as your Anceſtours: When you have done all that you can, you will not ſave them all; you will find among them, by aſcending, a great number which worſhipped Devils, and the Idols of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, you muſt neceſſarily leave them to the ſad Judgments of God. This example of your Fathers, which were ſaved in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> is a ſubject which comes to us often, and from all parts; 'tis the univerſal Illuſion; 'tis the Pillow on which you all lay yourſelves to ſleep: Many of your Ancient Paſtors have endeavoured to diſpute this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Illuſion; this would be a large Chapter, if we ſhould ſay all that may be ſaid concerning it, but I do not think it neceſſary, therefore I will ſay but two or three important things about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The firſt is, That we do willingly confeſs, That before the Reformation, there were perſons ſaved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion: About two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years agone, there were no Communions in the World which were not corrupt, at leaſt no conſiderable Communions or Societies. It muſt needs be, that God had his Elect there, for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves the World without them: Do not fear leaſt we ſhould ſend you to find theſe Elect among the <hi>Waldenſes, Abbigenſes, Wicklefiſts,</hi> and <hi>Huſſites;</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:49990:205"/>theſe were Fore-runners, and like Mornings which went before the Sun of Reformation: but theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties did not continue, nor did they make a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure great enough in the World, to include all the Elect there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But on the ſubject of thoſe men which were ſaved in corrupt Communions, before our Reformation, know firſt, That we muſt not (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at all) ſeek them among the Adult: Of a thouſand Children that are born, there is not the tenth part of them that attain to the Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; now all Children born in the Popiſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are ſaved, dying before the Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they have part in the advantage of the general Covenant of Chriſtianity, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Popery, and they have no part in the Corruptions which have been added thereto; for perſons have no part in the Errours which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Covenant, but when they know, receive or tollerate them: Behold, therefore, nine hundred of a thouſand which were ſaved in the moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt times. Now, when God has nine hundred Elect among a thouſand men, we cannot ſay he has left the World without Elect perſons, and that Chriſtianity remained uprofitable: there were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always a great number of Elect perſons in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But after all, it muſt be known, That among the Adult, the number of thoſe, of whoſe Salvation we might well preſume, in the times preceeding our Reformation, is ſo ſmall, that we may well be amazed to think of it: for Hiſtories do repreſent the Corruption not only of Worſhip, but alſo of Manners ſo horrible and univerſal, that a man knows not where to fix his eyes, to find a perſon that might be ſaved: The Clergy were overflown with Debauchery; the Monks were Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:49990:205"/>of profligate Perſons and Hypocrites; the Houſes of Nuns were filthy Bawdy-houſes: The People ſuffered themſelves to be born away by the torrent and examples of their Guides; the devout People ſcarcely knew the difference between the Creator and the Creature, and their Piety ſpent itſelf in Superſtitions, which are even a horrour to the wiſer Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nevertheleſs, let us ſuppoſe, that among all theſe, there were ſome Elect, and ſome ſaved, I do maintain, that it was abſolutely by Miracle; I ſay, by Miracle, in the litteral ſence of the word, and without figure: As a man which lives in a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Mire, ſunk over head and ears, lives there by a Miracle. For the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion is damnable; that is a certain point: Men are ſaved there; 'tis becauſe the Promiſe of God cannot be in vain, and he cannot be without Children; but the time of Miracles doth not continue always; and we do not find ourſelves obliged to explicate unto you the manner of Miracles; for we do not know, by that alone, that theſe are Miracles. And 'tis to you, my Brethren, a prodigious raſhneſs to re-plung yourſelves in a Communion, where your Fathers did not live, but by Miracle, in hopes that naturally you ſhall live there: 'Tis juſt as if the <hi>Jews,</hi> at this day, ſhould run head-long into the Red-ſea, in hopes to paſs well through it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Anceſtours did heretofore go through it without danger. God hath ways of withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that are his, from a Spirit of Lyes and Superſtition, whilſt they live, or at leaſt at their death, which we do not exactly underſtand. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, what your Apologiſt hath advanced, is very raſh, and very criminal; for he ſuppoſeth, with Monſieur <hi>Nicolas,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and your
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49990:206"/>other Convertors, That all thoſe that live in the <hi>Romans</hi> Church, and which were ſaved there, did partake in all her Superſtitions. This is falſe: and we are perſwaded, that an infinite number recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſtianity there, without taking part in Antichriſtianity, or that they repented of it before their death: Becauſe they do not comprehend how this may be done, was it not therefore done? This is to put bounds to the Divine Power: God hath his ways which are known to none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But I have almoſt no need of all this, that I have ſaid in the preſent Affair; for I declare to you, that although all your Anceſtours ſhould be ſaved in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whilſt they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in her Worſhips, although all the honeſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts at this day ſhould be ſaved, nevertheleſs you would not be in the way of Salvation, in the way in which now you are; and I will convince you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in two words: the firſt is, That your own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſt condemns you, <hi>Your Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were born and bred up in a Religion, and never heard any other Doctrines diſcourſed on.</hi> How dare you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſtate to that? Although he ſhould have mercy for ſuch perſons, would he have it for ſuch who have been brought up in the Boſom of Truth, who have not forſaken the Faith, but only the Profeſſion of it, who have ſubſcribed to Errours againſt their Conſcience, who adhere to Worſhips whereof the ſtrong and the weak do know the Filthineſs and Impurities? I have already ſaid unto you, and I do ſay it over again, <hi>To act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Conſcience,</hi> hath ſomething ſo aggravating in an evil action, that it makes a moderate Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition become a kind of Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. You do well perceive this, when, you go to Maſs with ſuch terrible regret and reluctancy:
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49990:206"/>it is your Conſcience that accuſes and condemns you. The other circumſtance, which puts you abſolutely out of all condition to compare with your Anceſtours, is, That by your weakneſs, you have ruined the greateſt Works of the Grace and Providence of God, which hath appeared ſince the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, that is to ſay, the Work of Reformation. 'Tis a thing paſt doubt, that ſince the death of the Apoſtles, there hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happened ſo great as this magnificent Work, whereby God at one ſhock did overthrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt half the Antichriſtian Empire, and very much weakned the other half.</p>
               <p>God is jealous of his Works, and he cannot but look with a Soveraign Indignation upon the lapſe of thoſe, who by their fall runied the late glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformation, and who proceeded ſo far as to blame it, and ſay as you ſay to us, <hi>We muſt not Separate, we muſt tolerate Abuſes, we muſt expect the Separation that Jeſus Chriſt will make at the Day of Judgment.</hi> Oh criminal Imagination! We muſt live in the Dirt and Slime; we muſt not reſtore to the Church her primitive Beauty; we muſt not diſengage the Truth from a hideous Maſs of Lyes, that do oppreſs it; we muſt not reſtore to God that Worſhip that hath been raviſhed from him; we muſt not remove from before his eyes ſo many Idols of Jealouſie; Have you never no holy Compunction for entertaining ſuch thoughts? Do not you perceive that your weakneſs in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering yourſelves to be led to Maſs, will ruine the Reformation, if God don't bring a ſpeedy Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thereunto? The Proteſtants of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> will have the ſame Complaiſance for their King, that you have for yours. Popery re-united, will confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49990:207"/>againſt all Proteſtant States; and then behold them ſpeedily tumbling into Superſtition by your Principles, and by your Conduct: So that by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing you, we ſhall ſoon ſee the fruit of much Blood, ſo many Martyrs, and ſo many glorious Confeſſions periſh and come to nothing. If you give attention to this, you will no more compare yourſelves to thoſe poor miſerable Ignorants, which went whither they were led, who being placed in a night of deep Superſtition, ſaw not a beam of better Light, which way ſoever they turned their eyes; on one hand they ſaw behind them a multitude of Ages corrupt as their own, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which came by ſo long a deſcent to them, that it appeared a natural ſtate; on the other hand, they ſaw before them an Authority which ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them up; a Clergy Magnificent, Powerful, Tyrannical, Numerous, rich, and abounding in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal Thunders; all this amazed them in ſuch a manner, that they could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the ſtate in which they were: We do not think them ſavable in this ſtate, but we think you far leſs ſo in the eſtate in which you are. God by a blow from Heaven (the moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that ever was ſeen) hath broken this diſmal Charm, he hath thundred, he hath lightned from Heaven, and diſperſed this Darkneſs. See whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you who have been Partakers of this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Light, be in an eſtate to flatter yourſelves with a Tolleration which God might have for your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours; ſo then if you gain any thing by your reaſonings, it will not be for you, but for your Children: for 'tis of them concerning whom we may ſay, it ſeems, they were born in that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they were educated therein, 'tis probable God will ſave them, although they do communicate in a Worſhip Impure, and full of Superſtitions.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49990:207"/>But, in truth, you gain nothing either for your Children or yourſelves. The paſt time will return no more: the times of Darkneſs and Ignorance may indeed return, but the times of Tolleration and Sufferance will never return again. That which is done, can never be undone. The Light of the Reformation hath caſt abroad a very great Luſtre, and although at this day men endeavour to ſtifle it, the memory thereof will never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and the Truth which we have ſet in ſo great a light, can never be aboliſhed: For which reaſon, both we and our Poſterity, in all following Ages, are obliged to ſee, follow, and entertain this Light: If we do otherwiſe, there will be neither Excuſe nor Illuſion which will be able to ſave us out of the hands of the Judge of the World.</p>

This good old man was arreſted on the Frontiers of <hi>Champagne,</hi> endeavouring to go out of the Kingdom; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallies; he appeals to the Parliament of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:49990:208"/>
                        <hi>Mets,</hi> whither he was tranſmitted; his Sentence was confirmed, and there he received that glorious Chain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which he breathed his last: he was ſo oppreſſed with Age and Infirmities, that he was ſo far from being able to bear a Chain, that he was not able to bear himſelf. His Judges were touched and afflicted with it; but they ſaid, they must make Examples. He went from <hi>Mets</hi> about the end of <hi>September,</hi> with his Brother-in-Law Mr. <hi>Chemet,</hi> who was Sixty nine years of age, and alſo in Chains, and much more infirm than he, having both a Rupture and an Aſthma. They were both full of joy, and gloried that they were found worthy to ſuffer for the Name and Truth of God. In all the places, through which they paſſed upon the Road, they found perſons which have given Teſtimony to their Conſtancy and Courage. Theſe two Martyrs bore their Chain to <hi>Marſeilles;</hi> but the end of their Journey was the end of their Race, and the time of their Coronation. They both died within a few days of each other, giving glory to God, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Truth, having never had any inclination to deny it, to deliver themſelves out of this ſad condition. Mr. <hi>Chantguyon</hi> is of the Bloud of the Martyrs; for he had for Grandfather <hi>Peter Chantguyon,</hi> who was one of thoſe that ſuffered death in the Maſſacre of <hi>Vaſſi,</hi> which was the Signal to the Civil War of the paſt Age.</p>
                     <p>How ſad ſoever the ſtate of theſe Confeſſors, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Name of Chriſt, may ſeem to be; 'tis neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infinitely leſs calamitous than that of thoſe who are lapſed and fallen, whoſe Conſcience makes them feel thoſe torments, which cannot eaſily be expreſſed. We have thought our ſelves obliged to communicate to you on this ſubject, the Letter of a Perſon of great Quality, Wife to one of our most famous Confeſſors. She had imitated the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of her Illuſtrious Husband for the ſpace of above a whole year: but the Tempter aſſailed her at an ill ſeaſon, and cauſed her to loſe her Crown. Behold how bitter the Tear are, which dropped from this unfortunate Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!</p>

Alas, my dear Mr. —, blame me not, if I have not acquainted you with the unhappy State in which I am; ſo great is my Confuſion, by reaſon of my Fall, that I have not the boldneſs to publiſh it my ſelf. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to expreſs unto you my Grief; 'tis ſuch, that I am not able to bear up against it; I am oppreſſed by the weight thereof; I am neither able to live, nor die; no body can conceive how lamentable my State is. I was ſo content with my Tryal, and ſo reſigned to the Will of God, that I could willingly have ſuffered death, if he had called me thereunto. I was acceptable, and in good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among all perſons, and enjoyed a wonderful rest, and repoſe of mind. 'Tis true, it was a little diſturbed by the coming of my Son, who tormented me extreamly; but all was to no purpoſe. God beſtowed thoſe Mercies on me, that I did not deſerve, nor did I make any ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns for them. I preſumed too much on my ſelf, yet I was not altogether without ſuſpicion. Alas, how do I find true in experience, that the Spirit is ready, but the Fleſh is weak; and that it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of an offended God! How great are my ſins, ſince the caſtigation of them is ſo terrible! Whilst I write, I pour out tears, I do aſſure you; and they flow from me night and day. I repent, O my God, help my weakneſs. I forgive you, that upon the first hearing of this thing, you cried out to all against me, and did judge that it was the World, Eſtate, and Eaſe, and to conclude, whatſoever you pleaſe, that was the cauſe thereof. I do not juſtifie my ſelf at all, nor do I plead any thing for my excuſe. I was weak and feeble, my Faith failed me in a time of need, and God did not inable me to ſuffer for his Name. In my unhappy ſtate, I have nevertheleſs this perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the mercy of my great God, that he will raiſe me up, and I ſhall glorifie him, whether it be in life or death, and that my Christ will be always gain to me, whether I live or die. He deſires not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:49990:209"/>but his converſion and life. My God, draw me, and I will run after thee, and do thou lead me to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Happineſs. Thou ſeest my heart, O my God, 'tis intirely thine, as well as my mouth: I will confeſs thee every-where. For the ſpace of four hours I was tormented by fifteen perſons; I cried with all my ſtrength, begging the Gallows and Death. I was nigh unto death; and how happy had I been, if I had died. I had not one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reſt, I knew not where I was, by reaſon of the great noiſe that was made: They made uſe of this great trouble and confuſion, and well perceiving that if they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me to return to my ſelf, they would gain nothing; therefore they repeated their Aſſaults with the greater force, and reduced me to the moſt pittiable condition in the world. I do not hide my anguiſh from any one; and I ſpeak with greater courage than ever, by the grace of my God I am prepared to ſuffer all the evil which can betide me in the world. The good God will be my defence, and my ſupport. I entreat you to pray to God for me, and don't think that I am faſtned to this World, I am more eſtranged from the love of it than ever. It ſeems to me that my Houſe is a Tomb: I will never more ſee any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; every thing that I ſee, reproaches me; my own Soul ſmites me ſo ſharply, that 'tis deplorable. Suffer with me in my grief, I pray you, I am worthy of pity: and oh that the great God would pardon and deliver us quickly from the Torments which we feel.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>THis Letter, which hath made known what Conſcience can do, in the matter of Subſcriptions, obliges me to bring to your minds a matter of fact which happened lately. In the month paſt, forty perſons embarked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Borders of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in a Veſlel of ſeven Tuns, that is, to ſpeak properly, in a Challop, and this without any Proviſions for the ſupport of Life: They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:49990:210"/>themſelves to death, and it may be ſaid, to a death apparently inevitable. For in ſuch a Veſſel, if the Wind and Sea had been contrary to them, they might have continued there long enough to have died of Famine. But as it pleaſed God, they were not above four days e're they gained the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and they paſſed them without eating. Behold what the force of Conſcience can do, and 'tis a good proof, that thoſe who are newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> are in great diſtreſs and perplexity. Amongst theſe perſons there was Monſieur the Count of <hi>Marancay,</hi> aged about ſeventy years, of the Province of <hi>Normandy;</hi> and Madam his Wife, Siſter to Monſieur the Marqueſs of <hi>Rochegifar.</hi> This new Story brings to my mind another of an elder date, which makes it farther appear what horrible Violence theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Subſcriptions do to the Conſciences of men. 'Tis the examples of a Woman named <hi>Jane Baille,</hi> Wife of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon named <hi>Iſaiah Viridit,</hi> of a little Village in the County of <hi>Charollois,</hi> named <hi>Parayle Moyneau.</hi> This poor woman being preſſed to the uttermoſt by her Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, took Pen from the hands of a Jeſuit named Father <hi>Langeroon,</hi> but at the ſame inſtant ſhe fell down as one dead, without any other ſign of life, than a convulſive motion in her right arm: The Jeſuit returned again ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time accompanied with the Major, the Delegate of the Intendant, and many other Papiſts. This poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for fear of loſing her Children, took the Pen a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in her hand to make her Subſcription; but in the very moment that ſhe made the letter <hi>J,</hi> which is the firſt letter of her name, ſhe fell into the ſame condition, and continued in it more than ſix hours. Every body was affected with it; the Major proteſted that he would have given a great deal of Money not to have been there on that occaſion, and it was more than five days e're he did recover from the diſorder that this Accident did occaſion to him. The Delegate himſelf was alſo moved at it, and promiſed to endeavour to get her a Paſport. There was
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:49990:210"/>no body but the Jeſuit, which was not moved at it; who ſaid, <hi>Let her burſt, ſhe is but an Hypocrite.</hi> The Delegate, inſtead of a Paſport for this poor woman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Order to carry her to a Convent: to execute his Order, he cauſed her to be ſeized on by four Serjeants, in whoſe arms ſhe fell into the ſame ſtate in which ſhe was in the two preceding times. But nevertheleſs, they laid her on a Horſe, like a Pack without motion, and without life, and carried her to the Convent of the Religious of St. <hi>Mary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On occaſion of theſe Events thus happening, (which diſcover the cruel Oppreſſions and Troubles of Mind in which thoſe are which have ſigned their Abjurations) I cannot forbear to ſpeak to thoſe that have been ſo unhappy, and have yet no ſenſe of it, nor ſorrow for it. And here I will ſpeak not only to thoſe who are yet in that unhappy ſtate, but alſo to thoſe who have found opportunity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Kingdom, and are riſen from their falls. We have ſeen ſome that have been touched and affected with it; but in truth the inſenſibility of the moſt part, makes me fear: And I tremble for ſome perſons, whoſe Piety was very eminent, who nevertheleſs count as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the fault which they have committed, in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves through cowardize from the honour whereto God called them, by ſuffering for his Name. I will make but one Reflection thereupon, to make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much their heart deceives them. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all the Reformed of <hi>France</hi> had imitated them, and that all preſerving the Truth in their hearts, had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned themſelves to this unhappy complaiſance for their Perſecutors, and ſigned their Abjuration; I ſay, if all had done ſo there had not been at this day in <hi>France</hi> one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, one Martyr, one man that had ſpoken for God, and maintained his Truth in Priſons, and in the midſt of Torments. Now this would have been the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all God's Judgments, the greateſt mark of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation for the Church, and the moſt frightful Curſe of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:49990:211"/>Heaven. For this would have been a Caſtigation of God, ſingular in its kind; for ſince there was a Church and Perſecutors, there was never any ſuch thing ſeen: there have been always Martyrs, always Confeſſors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Believers that have perſevered in Priſons, and in the midſt of Puniſhments. 'Tis the Honour of the Church, 'tis her Triumph, 'tis the Glory of God, and the Crown of Men: Yea, in humane Affairs, in Intereſts purely ſecular, in cauſes where men ſuffer only for Truth and humane Right, there are no Examples where all forſook it, and no body remained ſtedfaſt thereto. So that if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church of <hi>France</hi> had remained without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Martyrs, ſhe would have been charged with an eternal Reproach, which the Bloud of all mankind would never have waſht off. Now 'tis not owing to theſe weak perſons, who have ſubſcribed to ſave their Lives, and ſecure their Eaſe and Repoſe, that the Church of <hi>France</hi> is not branded with this horrible Reproach. For if all had imitated them, that had been exactly our caſe. I eaſily forgive this weakneſs to thoſe whoſe Zeal and Piety was not eminent; but I do acknowledge, that without difficulty I cannot forgive thoſe, who after they had obtained the Reputation of very Pious and Devout perſons, have denied and refuſed to Jeſus Chriſt the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of their Sufferings. Good God? what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this, to thoſe who perſevere in the Confeſſion of the Truth, the moſt part of whom never appeared ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as ſome of thoſe who are fallen, and flatter themſelves becauſe God has given them the opportunity of going out of the Kingdom, and recovering themſelves in a Country of Liberty and Freedom. I do not call this Perſeverance. I commend the prudence of thoſe which ſecure themſelves, but to account it their honour and reputation, I cannot. They ſacrifice their Country, their Wives, their Children, their Goods, and their Eaſe. I confeſs it, and 'tis true that is much. <hi>But what will not a man give for his life? Every one will give skin for skin, and all that he
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:49990:211"/>has, for his life: but put forth thine hand and touch his bone and his fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> He who hath not ſuffered thus far, hath not as yet given ſufficient proof of his love for the Truth. What ſhame and abatement of glory do theſe weak ones bring to our glorious Confeſſors, who reckon their lapſe and fall, for a thing of naught. According to them, our Martyrs are fools and obſtinate perſons, who ſuffer for a trifle, for a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature and ſubſcription which is required of them; which when they have given, they may ſave themſelves by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Kingdom. Alas, if this fault be ſo ſmall a thing, why do the holy Champions of God ſuffer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evils to avoid it? Is it the Spirit of God which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with this Courage? If it be God that is the cauſe of this Holy Perſeverance, to what Spirit may we attribute this cowardize of refuſing to Jeſus Chriſt our Bodies to glorifie his Name, and do honour to his Truth? All that theſe poor Wretches ſay to us, is this: If you had been in our place, it may be you would have done no better than we have done. This may be true, but is it a lawful Excuſe? Is the Crime the leſs, becauſe we are all capable of committing it?</p>
                     <p>I complain therefore, but do not rigorouſly condemn thoſe who have been ſo weak as to yield by Perſecution, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they ſigh and lament in the ſecret of their own Souls, acknowledging and confeſſing their fault and their ſin. But I confeſs, I am not able to bear thoſe, who after they have received much, have returned ſo little, and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons of great underſtanding, have had ſo little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and courage, and cannot yet confeſs the fault they have committed, is ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

So that I yield to your Reaſons, and at this time ſhall make an Apology for our ſelves againſt this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inhumane Accuſation. And firſt I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the Publick, that they give attention to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:49990:212"/>about which we are now to treat, for they will ſee one of the moſt famous Impoſtures, that the eyes of him who ſeeth all things, ever did behold; they will ſee what is the Spirit of the Religion which for ſo long time we have oppoſed: they will know what our Perſecutors are capable of.</p>
            <p>I Know not what cheating Prieſts, and Apoſtate Miniſters, did forge ſome years ſince an Act in the Name of the Synod of <hi>Lower Guyenne</hi> which was held at <hi>Montpazier</hi> in the year 1659. on the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> and ſome days following, that they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that the Reformed of that Province did at that time treat with the Engliſh about giving them entrance into the Kingdom, and delivering into their Hands all thoſe places of which they could make themſelves Maſters. This piece of Forgery appeared at that time, when they laboured with an incredible Heat, to thruſt the Reformed of <hi>France</hi> with all the ſpeed they could to their utmoſt Ruine. 'Twas all this time, that all the World (to pleaſe the Court) thought it a Duty to endeavour by all ſorts of Accuſations, to render them Odious. All places were full of Books, and Libels againſt <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſhew the Impurities of its Birth, the Horrors of its Life, the Furies of its Conduct, the Civil Wars that it did occaſion, the Spirit of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion wherewithal it is animated, the Dangers in which it engaged the Crown, the Precipices, to the very borders whereof, it carried the Realm, its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers attempts againſt the Perſons of our Kings, and the State. All then was well received which promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the principal end of the Clergy, and Court of <hi>France.</hi> And 'twas to animate the King to a ſpeedy execution of his Deſign, that this piece was forged. This Conſpiracy of the Synod of <hi>Monpazier,</hi> which was ſufficiently new, was the moſt proper means in the World to ſwell, and inlarge the Libels, which
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49990:213"/>were made againſt the Reformed. Nevertheleſs no Writer would own, or aſſert this Villainous Piece, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'twas viſible to be bad Mettal; Mr. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> was not a perſon ſcrupulous in the value, and worth of his Teſtimonies, when he endeavoured to ſupport what he had advanced; and this pretended Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>Montpazier</hi> was a Teſtimony ſufficiently good, it ſeems to me to prove the Theſis which he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defend in his Hiſtory of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> 'tis that the Spirit of Violence, Fury, and Rebellion is the Soul of our Religion. Nevertheleſs neither he, nor Mr. <hi>Arnald</hi> in his Apology for the Catholicks, nor Mr. <hi>Feure</hi> who came ſine, did ever dare to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Reputation on a Calumny ſo evident, and an Accuſation ſo ill proved and eſtabliſhed. I intreat you judge, whether it be true as they pretend, that the Court had the Act, and the Proof of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy in their hands, that the reſolution of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier</hi> in its Original had been put into the hands of the King, by Mr. <hi>Joly</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> and by the Cardinal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and that the Court had judged the piece true. Conſider, ſay I, whether Mr. <hi>Maimbourgh</hi> who writ by the Order of the Court, and on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make <hi>Calviniſm</hi> Odious, would have had no knowledge, or cognizance of it? And in caſe he had known, or underſtood it, is it not plain, and clear, that he would have made uſe of it, if he had thought it good, and valuable?</p>
            <p>But at laſt a Perſon is found fit to ſerve as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to this Reprobate, and Baſtard-Child, 'tis <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, a man the moſt given up to the Spirit of Calumny, that ever was in the World, the moſt deſperate, and frontleſs Lyer that Popery ever bred up, and to make his Elogy in one word, <hi>Bipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum nequiſſimus,</hi> the <hi>greatest of Knaves.</hi> This man publiſhes in the year 1682. a furious Libel againſt the Reformed, under the Title of, <hi>The Hiſtory of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts

               <p>THE Deputies of the Church of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repreſented to the Society, that in a Book made by Mr.<hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1682, Intituled; A Hiſtory of the <hi>Edicts of Pacification;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Soulier</hi> in the 393 page of that Book, and in that which follows, it hath reported an Act, which he pretends to be made by the Synod of <hi>Monpazier,</hi> to give thanks to Mr. <hi>Ricottier,</hi> and <hi>Vignier,</hi> both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for the Care they had taken to engage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Intereſts of the Reformed Churches of this Kingdom, with theſe two Circumſtances noted in the Margin of that Book, the one that the ſaid Mr.<hi>Ricottier</hi> was Miniſter of <hi>Clairac,</hi> the other that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was yet alive then, and at the time of the ſaid Act, adding that the Original thereof had been put into the hands of the ſaid <hi>Vignier,</hi> and taken in his Cloſet after his Death by Mr. <hi>Monier</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Nerac,</hi> that this Act was put into the hands of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the late Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> and whereas this Act is a ſuppoſitious piece, and injurious to the Honour of the Synod, and to the Memory of the ſaid <hi>Ricot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi> who was then Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> they account themſelves particularly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make the Calumny of this Act appear, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49990:215"/>their inviolable Fidelity to the Service of the King; therefore they repreſented the ſaid Book, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſaid Legier Book of the Synod held at <hi>Montpazier,</hi> the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1659, deſiring the Commiſſioners to view the ſaid Book in the page marked, and quoted, and likewiſe the Legier Book of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier;</hi> but the Gentlemen, the Commiſſaries ſaid, it was no part of their Commiſſion to examine Books, or Papers of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Synods, that it appertained to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to look to their juſtification, where, and as they ſhould think good, that for their parts they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to take any cognizance thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Society after they had reflected upon the Importance, and meaning of the ſaid Act, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined it together with the Legier Book of the Synod held at <hi>Montpazier,</hi> the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1659, it appeared by comparing theſe two pieces, that the aforeſaid Act printed in the Book of <hi>Soulier</hi> is not in the ſaid Papers of the Synod; and moreover that the falſeneſs of this pretended Act is clearly proved by two Circumſtances in matter of Fact, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that by the Table of the ſaid Legier Book of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> it appears that the late Mr. <hi>Ricottier</hi> was not Miniſter of the Church of <hi>Clairac;</hi> the other Circumſtance is this, that 'tis certain that <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> died the thirteenth of <hi>September,</hi> 1658, and ſo it was impoſſible that the Churches of this Province could have any Correſpondence with him in the year 1659. After which the Society reſolved that humble Remonſtrances ſhould be made to his Majeſty, to aſſure him of the inviolable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity that the ſaid Churches had preſerved, and ſhould always preſerve for his Service, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that he would be pleaſed to appoint that the ſaid <hi>Soulier</hi> ſhould be Condemned to make them ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. as he ſhould judge fit, with prohibition both

                           <p>The Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> hath made his Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Motion and Act of the Synod of <hi>Thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens,</hi> after his manner; we will examine them by and by. The Court of <hi>France</hi> being under no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition to hear the Juſtifications, which they could produce on this ſubject, they were obliged to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie themſelves to the Publick. And becauſe <hi>France</hi> was no place, nor had been for a long time, in which it was permitted to defend the cauſe of God, and the Innocent, they were forced to Print what they had to ſay thereon in a ſtrange Country. The Author of a Book intitled, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Monſieur</hi> Arnold, inſerts in his Work, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments by which this pretended Act might be proved falſe: and he finds no leſs than Nine which he calls invincible, and which indeed are ſo, and will always be ſo, in the opinion of every equal and diſintereſted Judge. At the ſaid time he there makes a little Hiſtory of the divers Gradations, by which the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> hath paſſed to become an Author, ſince he was either a Taylor or a Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49990:216"/>at <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſhew what credit ought to be given to the Reports of ſuch a man, who owes his Advancement to his Miſſionary Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> to a Spirit of Violence, Paſſion, and Falſhood againſt the Reformed. For behold exactly the Spirit of Mercers, Shooe-makers, and Cutlers who have left their Trades and Shops to aſcend the Bench, and to run about <hi>France</hi> with the Memoirs of <hi>Veron.</hi> The Prieſt <hi>Soulier,</hi> who had been very well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for his Hiſtory of the Edicts of Paciſica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a Penſion which the Clergy had aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, being allured by the Bait, judged it convenient, to make a great Book exactly on the ſame ſubject, upon which he had made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one. 'Tis no longer the <hi>Hiſtory of the Edicts of Pacification,</hi> 'tis at this day, <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, <hi>containing its Birth, its Progreſs, its Decay and End in</hi> France. But don't miſtake yourſelves, 'tis the ſame thing, the firſt was in little, this is in great; 'tis, nevertheleſs, the ſame Countenance, the ſame Picture, as well as the ſame Author, and the whole Dedicated <hi>to the King,</hi> that is to ſay, Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> is willing to raiſe himſelf Succeſſour to Monſieur <hi>Maimburgh.</hi> He had put his Calumnies againſt the Reformation of <hi>France,</hi> into an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his firſt Work, this got him only a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Penſion; his knowledge and his parts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean and limited; to turn to ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and make a new Book againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> to gain a new Penſion; this was not very eaſie, therefore he judged it more convenient to make again the ſame Book under a new form, much larger than the former, hoping that this would procure for him a much more ample Reward: Nor was he miſtaken, for as a Recompence of this laſt Work, they have procured for him an Abbacy in <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> ſo that from hence forth 'twill be
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:49990:216"/>no longer <hi>Soulier the Prist;</hi> 'tis <hi>Monſieur the Abbot:</hi> and I hope for his next work it will be, <hi>My Lord the Biſhop.</hi> And then we ſhall ſee the Proverb exactly turned, it will not be from a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to a <hi>Miller,</hi> but from a <hi>Miller</hi> to a <hi>Biſhop.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the Preface of this new Book, which we expect, and which muſt promote Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> to a Biſhoprick; he will ſay no more as he hath in the Preface of this, <hi>I content myſelf to anſwer theſe paſſionate Writers, that my Conſcience doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, about any of theſe matters of Fact, and that I have ſo little laboured for temporal Conſiderations, that I aſſure myſelf the Miniſter <hi>Jurien,</hi> how able ſoeven he ſeems in his Searches and Inquiries, will not find my name in the diſtribution of Rewards, nor of that of Benefices.</hi> The Miniſters without being very able in Searches and Inquiries, will then eaſily find the name of Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> among the Diſtributions of Rewards and Benefices, and they hope that this lucky Hiſtorian will ſuddenly have a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Honour, when he ſhall have put the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Calviniſm</hi> under a third form. In expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of this new Dignity, and without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he has at preſent, we ſhall not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this honeſt man, under any other appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation but that of <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, as hath been cuſtomary unto him. So then Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt hath thought good to give <hi>Calviniſm</hi> a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Blows after its Death, and to covet it with Infamy by a great Book of ſeven hundred Pages, in Quarto: He muſt be an Enemy to his own Repoſe, and ſearch out buſineſs out of briskneſs of Humour, that will trouble himſelf to Anſwer the Accuſations and Falſities wherewith this great Volumne is filled: for excepting a few matters of Fact, there is nothing in it but what Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Maimburgh,</hi> and others have
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49990:217"/>ſaid, to which it is believed that the <hi>Calviniſt</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> as Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> calls them, have anſwered very well, and very much at large. But we cannot, nor ought not to neglect this buſineſs of the Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> becauſe 'tis a new thing, and becauſe <hi>Soulier,</hi> in purſuit of a Commiſſion granted him by the King, hath made a furious expence of Wit to defend the Truth of what he had affirmed: As he hath repeated in his Hiſtory of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> all which was in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Edicts, but dreſſed up after a more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and ample manner, he hath likewiſe repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and reaſons which may ſupport the truth of it. We have ſeen the firſt Act without Form, and without Subſcriptions; we muſt ſee it, ſuch as it is, at preſent, in this new Hiſtory, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and augmented by the Author: corrected in the name <hi>Daret,</hi> which is changed into <hi>Durel;</hi> augmented by four Subſcriptions which are here below. But after all, maimed of three Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Annotatiods, which do a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Piece, and him that produced it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it therefore according to its new Edition.</p>

There are no attempts imaginable which the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> doth not make, to defend this falſe Piece: But we ſee that God doth ſtrike theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors with a Spirit of Blindneſs, ſo that they ſtumble in places where it were eaſie for them to be upon their guard. The Work hath appeared in publick a long time ſince, and we were adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed from <hi>France,</hi> that this part thereof was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed, leud, and worthy that we ſhould make the Injury and Reproach thereof fall upon its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> of whom Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> ſpeaks with ſo much contempt, have ſo little eſteem for his Works, that they did not put themſelves to the trouble of obtaining this. And the Printers of <hi>Holland,</hi> who print all things at are ſaleable, did not think that the Sale of the <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Calviniſm would pay the charge of the Preſs. The reaſon therefore why we An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to it ſo late is, becauſe we could not recover any Copy thereof, at laſt we reſolved to obtain it by an Expreſs, otherwiſe it had never paſſed our Frontiers. We have therefore ſeen and read it, and have judged that the Conſpiracy of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier,</hi> did indeed deſerve that we ſhould reply to it. But before we defend our Arguments for the Falſhood thereof, and produce new ones, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary once more that you know who the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> is, that you may alſo know of what weight his Authority is: but I chooſe rather that you know it from the mouth of one of his Brethren, than from ours; for which reaſon we ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Letter which Monſieur <hi>Le Feure,</hi> a Doctor of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> did write to one of his Friends concerning this Gentleman, and this ſince the <hi>Hiſtory of the Birth, Progreſs, Decay, and Ruine of</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm appeared in the World.</p>

                     <p>I Muſt confeſs faithfully, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed, that a politick Diſſimulation of thoſe Reſentments, which a man cannot diſcover without prejudice to his intereſt, was not the Vice of our Nation, and that it ought to be the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of men of the Character which we bear; I ſpeak of Reſentments which are believed juſt, and whoſe end is the Defence of Truth, and not a Chimera of Reputation, or falſe worldly Honour: I have been hitherto, and am yet perſwaded that 'tis to be an Enemy to Truth, to ſuffer it to be oppreſſed then, when there is reaſon to fear that a man ſhall draw upon himſelf the Perſecution of thoſe which oppoſe it; for I have made to myſelf a Rule of that ancient Maxim of the Fathers of the Church, <hi>Let us be Baniſhed ſo the Truth be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Behold, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the only reaſon why I have had ſo few Conteſts with perſons of eminent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſo that the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> had paſſed in ſilence, if he had not obſerved a quite oppoſite conduct. Judge thereof, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> by the following Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the Year 1681, the learned Jeſuit, Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> being choſen by the Clergy for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent-General, and Counſel to the Syndicks of the Dioceſs of this Kingdom, proſecuting the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Temples of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, built contrary to the Edicts, publiſhed a Collection about thoſe matters, printed at <hi>Paris</hi> by Monſieur <hi>Leonard,</hi> Bookſeller to the Clergy: In the time of this Impreſſion, Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little Work, where, by way of Eſſary, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:49990:219"/>the Syndecks of Ignorance, as having ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Preſervation of many Churches which ought to have been deſtroyed. The Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this blow would fall directly upon him, thought himſelf obliged to refute this Dream of Monſieur <hi>Soulier:</hi> he therefore employs about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the laſt Pages of his Book, to convince this <hi>Monſieur</hi> of Ignorance. He concludes them by accuſing him <hi>of Falſhood, of Calumnie, and of being a perſon that at most knew no more than to Read and Write, and ſending him to the exerciſe of his firſt Trade and Employment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> ſaw and diſſembled the thing from 1681, until the end of this Year 1686, that is to ſay near ſix Years. Why did he keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſo long? and why ſpeaks he now, after he had been ſo long dumb? Think of it what you pleaſe, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> but behold that which I think moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable concerning it: The Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> was alive, and is now dead. <hi>Soulier</hi> owed to him what he knew in the matter of Edicts, againſt thoſe of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, which he hath dreſſed over again to give a taſt of them to the World. The Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> made uſe of him to be a Servant and a Scribe, and he is not the first, who from the Servant of an Author, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Author himſelf. The Servants of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians do every day ſteal the Secrets of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                     <p>The Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> is therefore dead, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> hath filled up his place in a very ſhort ſpace of time. The Revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> followed, by the Deſtruction of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of thoſe of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, having rendered his pretended Employment much more unprofitable, than the Work which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches me for ſending into the World a little
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:49990:219"/>too late; nevertheleſs, being puffed up with his new Place and Preferment, he was not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any longer to be accuſed of Ignorance.</p>
                     <p>But why does he fall upon me? 'Tis becauſe I being neceſſarily engaged to take part in the buſineſs conteſted, by Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> and him, I put myſelf on the ſide of the Maſter againſt the Servant, and to ſave myſelf the labour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing <hi>Soulier,</hi> I ſaid that it had been done by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meſnier.</hi> Yea, I had the Charity not to name <hi>Soulier,</hi> when I ſaid, as a ſimple Hiſtorian, in the 208th Page, of the ſecond Part of my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ection, That this Father, knowing what had been his firſt Employment, counſelled him to explain that <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi>

The Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> (which I have tranſcribed, in the Chapter concerning Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi>) doing him the ſame favour in a multitude of heads wherein he is accuſed by this Father; Is he a Proteſtant? I could ſooner have pardoned him, if he had only diſſembled that the Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> is the Author of the Evil which I have done him: Dogs bite the Staff wherewithal we ſtrike them. But that he makes me the Eccho of the Proteſtants, in the contempt which they put upon him, when I plaid the good Husband in what concerned his Reputation, by treating him leſs ill, than thoſe of our Religion which know him better than I; this is that which cannot be endured.</p>

I do nevertheleſs affirm, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> that I find my ſelf all at once diſarmed, when I think that there is nothing of Merit or Honour to be gotten by ſuch an Adverſary. He boaſts at this day, that he hath ſtudied the buſineſs of Edicts thirty Years, and in his Work of 1681, he confeſſes (as Father <hi>Meſnier</hi> reproaches to him) that he had never ſeen thoſe that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had granted to the Cities of the League, whereof, nevertheleſs he was willing to make uſe againſt the Syndicks, and the Cenſors of the Dioceſs of the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Who will not deſpiſe an Adverſary which proves that I have not the leaſt knowledge of the Affairs of thoſe of the Proteſtant Reformed Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have quoted a National Synod held at <hi>Loudun.</hi> And to maintain this falſe Accuſation, he ſays, Page the 681 of his Book, That <hi>if I had only read the firſt leaf of the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, I ſhould have found in the Table of the National Synods, of thoſe of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that there war never any held at</hi> Loudun. For if there were never any held at <hi>Loudun,</hi> why did he write in the 63 Page of his <hi>New Bernard,</hi> this which follows in expreſs terms: <hi>The twelfth Article of the National Synod held at</hi> Loudun, <hi>the</hi> 5th <hi>of</hi> April, 1596, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> This was pitty, but there is more in the caſe. This Doctor, in point of Tables of Books, this man converſant in the matter of Edicts, for theſe thirty Years, knows not, that in the Year 1659, there was a National Synod of thoſe of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion held at <hi>Loudun,</hi> by the permiſſion of his Majeſty: A man is therefore Ignorant, according to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Author, becauſe he knows that which is, arid is not ignorant of it; or becauſe he doth not fain himſelf ignorant thereof, as he doth.</p>

After this, is he to be believed, when he, ſays, I have tranſcribed, or copied him? My Work contains 800 Pages, and he accuſes me to have Abridged the biggeſt, and the moſt conſiderable of his Books, in the fifteen firſt. Never was falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood publiſhed with ſo little colour: I make the Publick Judge thereof; and if I have any thing wherewith to reproach myſelf, it will be that I was not willing to ſee the faults of his Works, that I might not be obliged to reprove them. I have ſaid for example, in the twelfth Page of my Work, that <hi>Peter Mengin</hi> was burnt at <hi>Meaux,</hi> with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of his Companions, by a Decree of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Paris;</hi> he ſays, in the ninth Page of his <hi>Hiſtory of Edicts of Pacification,</hi> that he was burnt with fourteen of his Companions, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Decree, which takes notice of no more but thirteen, and thoſe mentioned by their Names, and Sirnames. I could produce a hundred faults of like nature, but to what good purpoſe would It be? An Author like him, who fears not to give the Lie to the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and to ſome of its illuſtrious Members, bears ſo viſible a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Malice, in the opinion of all honeſt men, that if they would pray for him, it is that the Clergy might double his Penſion to put him to ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>Behold the proof of what I affirm, Authors of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, having main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their Works, that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was granted to their Fathers, as an acknowledgment of the Service they had done for the State, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Soulier,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Calviniſm, ſays, That it was the ſtrangeſt Paradox that ever was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed <hi>it being not true that they had obtained this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict by their Services.</hi> Nevertheleſs, the General Aſſembly of <hi>France,</hi> held at <hi>Paris</hi> in the Years

Therefore to keep a neceſſary temperament, he granted them an Edict larger than thoſe which went before, which is called the Edict of</hi> Nantes.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Monſieur,</hi> will you not think me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed withal, for anſwering more at large to the Dreams and Dotages of Monſieur <hi>Soulier.</hi>

But behold enough to juſtifie me againſt ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Enemy. Let him write till Dooms-day about theſe matters, I ſhall not looſe my time to recover him from his Wandrings, becauſe the Publick never loves Repetitions; and beſides, when a perſon hath once written things, like a man of Honour and Conſcience, he muſt leave God to do the reſt, and ought to be aſſured, that time will always acknowledge and confeſs true Merit.

It ſeems to me, that theſe two Authors, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Meſnier</hi> the Jeſuit, and Monſieur <hi>le Ferre,</hi> are worthy of credit in the preſent Affair: We have therefore affirmed nothing againſt <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, which is not certain: he is of baſe Extraction, he came from the Dung-hill; he underſtands neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latine;</hi> he was a Mechanick; he ſtole ſome Learning from Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> and of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is become a Maſter. We have reported this after others, without any intent of making an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation or Crime thereof: On the contrary, it would be much to his Reputation and Praiſe, if he had advanced himſelf by honeſt ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods: If could be ſaid, he was nothing, but has made himſelf ſomething by his Induſtry, and by the Learning he hath obtained; he ought to he commended inſtead of being blamed for it. But we conclude quite otherwiſe from thence, 'tis that taking his Original from the Dung-hill, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mean Education, he retains the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof, and is become eminent by ſurpaſſing his Maſters in Cheats, in Iniquities, Falſhoods, and Lies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On this laſt point we call his <hi>Maſter, Meſnier,</hi> Witneſs againſt him, who inſtructed him in the Profeſſion of bidding Defiance to Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and Conſcience, in favour of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He concludes,</hi> ſays Monſieur <hi>le Ferre, by accuſing him of Falſhood, and Calumnie, and as being a perſon who at moſt knew no more than to write and read, and by ſending him to the exerciſe of his firſt Trade and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</hi> Monſieur <hi>le Ferre</hi> is not content to prove the Falſhood of the Prieſt <hi>Soulier,</hi> by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> he makes it evident by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and Examples which he gives thereof, which doth demonſtrate, that this man is capable
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49990:222"/>of denying the moſt notorious matters of Fact, as is this, that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to our Fathers, as an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Services which he had received from them. Such is that which he affirms every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that we have always been the Aggreſſors in all the Civil Wars; ſuch is that which he ſays, That upon all occaſions, by ſecret Practiſes, or open Rebellions, we have conſpired the Ruine of the Monarchy, and the Regal Authority: To conclude, ſuch is that which he maintains, That the Maſſacre of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was not a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved buſineſs, but the Reſolution was taken upon the ſpot, and that it was rather an event of Chance, or Hazzard, than an effect of Deliberation. A man may find a hundred paſſages in this Hiſtory, much more loud and heinous than theſe, which make it appear how much this man is conſecrated to Lying, and devoted to the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Therefore nothing hath been affirmed in the Hiſtory given of his Life, but what is true, and thoſe two ſmall circumſtances, concerning the Falſhood whereof, he makes ſuch Out-cries, <hi>viz.</hi> his Reſidence in the Street <hi>Geures,</hi> and his <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie</hi> in one of the Lordſhips of Monſieur <hi>de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillac,</hi> are not ſufficiently important, to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an Accuſation of Falſhood, eſpecially when we had been miſinformed therein: Seeing theſe are the only things to which he hath thought fit to reply, in the Abridgment of his Hiſtory, 'tis a proof he hath nothing to ſay, about all the reſt which is much more important; but this is enough to make known our Accuſor; let us come now to the Accuſations.</p>
               <p>We will follow our Author ſtep by ſtep, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs without ſtaying ourſelves upon the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies which he mingles among things, which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49990:223"/>may ſeem to be of ſome weight. After he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the pretended Act of the Conſpiracy of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier,</hi> he gives the reaſon why he produced it in his firſt Hiſtory without Form, and without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As I had no deſign to do wrong to particular perſons,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but only to ſhew what was the Spirit of</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſm, <hi>and what it is capable of; I ſuppreſſed the names of thoſe who Signed this Confederation, in my Hiſtory of Edicts.</hi> So that 'tis out of Charity, that <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt did ſuppreſs the Names of thoſe that Signed this Act; This is admirable, good Prieſt! Who is there that does not admire his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Are not all his Writings full of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of this excellent Vertue? 'Tis out of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that he blew the fire to kindle the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he made odious Libels, full of Lies, againſt perſons that never did him any wrong. Obſerve that the Charity of this good Prieſt doth not conſider, that to ſpare ſome ſingle perſons, it neglects what it owed to the King: for a man is always obliged to diſcover Conſpirators, without having regard to ſingle perſons. He will not fail to anſwer to this, the King knew the buſineſs: for he tells us, that this Act was given to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillion,</hi> by Monſieur <hi>Joly</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> and that Monſieur the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Bouillion,</hi> gave it to the King. This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, but this is the very thing that makes us ſuſpect his Charity. For ſince the King knew the Names of the Conſpirators, a man could not do them wrong, nor expoſe them more to the Diſpleaſure of the King: his Majeſty having not judged it fit to chaſtiſe them, they had nothing farther to fear by the publication of their Names. So that till the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> hath given us more valuable proofs of his Charity, we will ſay, that the true
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:49990:223"/>reaſon why he gave us this Act without Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, was becauſe he very well foreſaw that the Subſcriptions would diſcover the Myſtery, and the Cheat.</p>
               <p>It may be that his Monſieur <hi>Daret,</hi> who was not in the World, nor never had been, and of whom he had never heard any thing ſpoken, did appear to him, a perſon very improper to fill the place of an Aſſiſtant-Moderator, in which he ought to do and ſay much, and by conſequence could not be ſupplied by a Phantome. Beſides Monſieur <hi>Aſimont,</hi> who was the Secretary then living, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reſiding in <hi>France,</hi> would have been able, although he were a Miniſter, and a perſecuted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and had his mouth ſtoped, to have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him the injury of this Falſhood: for 'tis known that ſingle perſons take theſe ſort of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more warmly, than whole Bodies and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, becauſe the danger is more urgent and preſſing upon them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that the Synod of <hi>Thonnins,</hi> in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> in the Year 1683, drew up the Act which we have ſeen above. But the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> ſays thereon, <hi>Nevertheleſs theſe Gentlemen, who had never taken this Reſolution, but the better to hide their Game, ſtaid there.</hi> And ſome Pages after, <hi>Did they proceed any farther in purſuit of this Reſolution?</hi> That is to ſay, to carry their Complaints to the King, and proſecute <hi>Soulier</hi> as a Calumniator: <hi>All theſe threatnings,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are vaniſhed into ſmoke, and it was well ſeen, that all this noiſe war nothing elſe but a pure effect of their Policy.</hi> This is very wicked in the mouth of a man who knows, as all the World doth, that from the Synod of <hi>Thonnins,</hi> unto the firſt Miſſion of the Dragoons, there paſſed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fifteen or ſixteen Months, that the ruin of the Reformed was ſworn, and determined to a
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:49990:224"/>ſtated time, that for the ſpace of four Years no Paper of Remonſtrance, Complaint, Juſtification, Requeſt, or thing of like nature would be received from them; that the perſon of the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible for them; that all the Tribunals of the Kingdom had in like manner been ſhut upon them: <hi>Soulier</hi> tells us, that the Province of <hi>Guyenne</hi> had Monſieur <hi>Janicon</hi> for Deputy-General at <hi>Paris;</hi> but he might very well have known alſo, ſeeing he knows ſo many things, that it was in the Synod of <hi>Thonnins,</hi> in 1683, that Monſieur <hi>Janicon</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himſelf of this Office, becauſe he knew that from thenceforth it would be to no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that they would hear no man who had any thing to ſay for Juſtification of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 'Tis true that the Synod named Monſieur <hi>Charron</hi> an Advocate, and another Deputy to go and carry this Complaint to the King; But who then dared to appear at the Court? He muſt have a deſire to ſee the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what Bread men eat there. This Villain knows all this, and inſults over poor oppreſſed perſons, becauſe of their ſilence in a time when it was for them a Crime no leſs than Treaſon, to dare to complain of any kind of Injuſtice what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was. The Deputies of the Synod of <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Guyenne,</hi> would have been well received, had they gone to complain of <hi>Soulier,</hi> a man that the Clergy had purpoſely ſet up to Defame, Injure, and Deſtroy them; in a time when the Court had already diſpatched, if I may ſo ſay, Commiſſions to the Dragoons to treat the Reformed as Rebels, and open declared Enemies.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The first Argument of Falſhood, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifications thereof.</note>I paſs the Reflections which <hi>Soulier</hi> makes uſe of to deſtroy the Arguments and Mediums
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:49990:224"/>which we have made uſe of, to prove this Act of <hi>Montpazier</hi> to be a falſe Impoſture. Firſt we have ſaid, That there never was a Synod more known, and underſtood by our Enemies: Beſides an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Papiſts, Monks, and paltry Prieſts, the Biſhop of <hi>Cahors</hi> was there, and eſpecially Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Soulier,</hi> as he himſelf informs us. This Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance may be of uſe to us, to make very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjectures concerning the Original of this Act. Beſides all this, the King had a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary there. From all which we conclude, that there was no likelihood that theſe Miniſters ſhould be ſuch Fools, to treat of an Affair of this nature in a place where there were ſo many perſons their Enemies. <hi>Soulier</hi> ſays thereon, That the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were not admitted to their Aſſembly; that we know well, but we alſo know that the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy are at expence for Spies, and that they never fail to know all that they pleaſe. 'Tis known that this Aſſembly was made up of about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paſtors, and well near as many Elders: that among theſe men there were thoſe which had no true Piety, nor any Zeal for their Religion, as it appears by their Revolt and Apoſtacy. Theſe men are indiſcreet, intereſted, eaſie to be gained, and the Agents of the Clergy know them very well.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Commiſſary, <hi>Soulier</hi> ſays things which the Providence of God hath permitted, to confound theſe Impoſtures. Firſt, he ſays, That Monſieur of St. <hi>Blancard</hi> was the King's Man in this Synod, and we ſhall ſee by and by, from the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of four Witneſſes, which were there preſent, that it was Monſieur <hi>de Villefranche</hi> of <hi>Vivans,</hi> who was Commiſſary. This is, ſay I, an effect of the Vengeance of God for the Confuſion of theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures. For there was nothing ſo eaſie as to know
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:49990:225"/>who was the King's Agent there; the Acts of all the Synods were ſent to the Court, the Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were always named there, and they even ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and made a particular mark on the Copy which they ſent to the King. And theſe Copies are kept in the Office of Monſieur <hi>Chaſtean-neuf.</hi> This makes it ſuſpicious, that this Impoſture was not form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paris,</hi> but in the Province, in ſome place where not having ſufficient Memorials, they depended too much upon the treacherous Memory of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Yea, it appears that <hi>Soulier</hi> is a Lyer, when he ſpeaks as an abſolute Diſpoſer of all that was in the Office of Monſieur <hi>Chaſtean-neuf.</hi> For if he had been admitted thither, he would have rectified the Error that himſelf, or other Authors of this Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had made. And that <hi>Soulier</hi> may not deceive the Publick, by ſaying, that Monſieur St. <hi>Blancard,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Villefranche de Vivans</hi> are two names, but not two perſons: it muſt be known that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Blancard</hi> was a Gentleman of <hi>Agenois,</hi> Uncle of the <hi>Chevalier Montand,</hi> heretofore Captain in a Regiment of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and this Monſieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card</hi> hath been dead theſe ſix or ſeven years: And Monſieur <hi>de Villefranche de Vivans</hi> was a Gentleman of <hi>Perigort,</hi> Uncle to Monſieur the Count of <hi>Vivans,</hi> Lieutenant-General in the Army of the King. He died not above three or four years ſince.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which he ſays is, That Monſieur St. <hi>Blancard</hi> was of the Reformed Religion, that he might be of Intelligence with the Synod in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, and that ſo 'tis not to be admired, that he did not reveal it. What a Prodigy is this! That a Commiſſary of the King in our Synods, ſhould betray his Maſter, and his Prince in a point of Conſpiracie againſt the State, without giving him any notice of it: Although theſe Commiſſaries had been capable of ſhutting their eyes on ſome ſmall
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:49990:225"/>thing, hath there been any example in theſe laſt times of a man commiſſioned by the King, in our Aſſemblies, who hath ſuffered, or diſſembled ſuch undertakings? Would not the Juſtice of the King have proſecuted a perſon guilty of ſuch a Crime, with the utmoſt ſeverities of puniſhment? The King knew, ſaw, and was informed of all this Conſpiracy, and the Court kept ſilent, both with reſpect to St. <hi>Blancard,</hi> the pretended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, and with reſpect to the Synod. Be it St. <hi>Blancard,</hi> or <hi>de Vivans,</hi> the one and the other were yet in the Land of the Living, in the Year 1677, when this forged Piece was put into the hands of the King, and yet they were never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. We ſee this man hath loſt all judgment and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>The third thing which <hi>Soulier</hi> ſays is, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Commiſſary were faithful to the King, they might act in this Affair without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or participation, becauſe in Affairs of this nature, the ſecret is not committed but to ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſons, and the other Members of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly have no part therein: Behold another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture well worthy the contrivance of <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt: that is to ſay, that there are four perſons which made this great Conſpiracy, and without communicating it to the Paſtors, or the Elders, they treat about introducing an Enemy, and a foreign Nation into <hi>France:</hi> And how could four Miniſters give Aſſurances in an Affair which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon ſo many, without communicating it to them? Four Miniſters attempt to manage a whole great Province! We know the Jealouſie which reigns among all men of what Character ſoever they be: Is it imaginable, that a hundred Miniſters, and ſo many Elders, ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to follow the Inſpirations, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:49990:226"/>the Obligations of four Miniſters, in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair wherein they were not truſted, and in which there is no leſs than their Life, and being broken alive upon the Wheel, at ſtake? In truth a man would think that a clap of Thunder had aſtoniſhed this miſerable Calumniator.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond Argument of Falſhood, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification thereof.</note>The ſecond Argument that we employed, to prove the Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of this Impoſtour, was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there was no likelihood that the Reformed of <hi>Guyenne</hi> ſhould attempt a thing which might have ſuch miſchievous Conſequences, in a time when they had no reaſon to complain of the Court, becauſe they enjoyed their Liberties peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enough. To this <hi>Soulier</hi> ſays two things, Firſt, <hi>That in our Conduct there are many examples of Unfaithfulneſs, in the very times that we peaceably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Favours that had been granted to us; and therefore we have been very ſilly in</hi> deſiring to juſtifie ourſelves from this Treaſon, becauſe we had no occaſion that ſhould prompt us to commit it. Thereupon he reckons up the proofs of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation: <hi>For Example,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they enjoyed peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably all the Priviledges which had been granted them by the Edict of</hi> January, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1561: <hi>they had the publick Exerciſe of their Religion, in the Subburbs of</hi> Paris, <hi>&amp;c. this did not hinder but that they treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three Months after with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them</hi> Haure de Grace. Another Example: <hi>Theſe Gentlemen enjoyed peaceably the Edict of Peace, which was granted them before</hi> Orleans, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1563, <hi>nevertheleſs, to the prejudice of this Peace, and the Edict which the</hi> Calviniſts <hi>did very peaceably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, they took Arms again in cold Blood.</hi> He adds many other Examples to prove his Accuſation; but in truth my patience is ſpent, and for the eaſe
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:49990:226"/>and quiet of my mind, I cannot reſolve to follow this Calumniator to the end: Who can endure, without Indignation, that which he hath the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to affirm, That it was the <hi>Hugenot</hi> Party which began the War, after the Edict of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> All the World knows that it was the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who cauſed the Maſſacre at <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> in the midſt of that <hi>Peace</hi> which <hi>we did ſo quietly enjoy.</hi> He who anſwered <hi>Maimburgh</hi>'s Hiſtory of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> hath made it appear, by the cleareſt light, that the firſt Civil War which came after the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> was no War of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it had its ſource in the implacable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds which were between the Houſes of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Montmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency;</hi>

All this hath been made good by Witneſſes that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reproached; it hath been made evident, that Religion was only the pretence, which the great men made uſe of to mutinie the people: It
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:49990:227"/>hath been proved, that during this pretended <hi>Peace,</hi> which the Calviniſts <hi>did quietly enjoy,</hi> under the ſhadow of the Edict of <hi>January,</hi> ſaith <hi>Soulier,</hi> there were above three thouſand perſons which periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Maſſacres, or by Courts of Juſtice; that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> came to <hi>Paris</hi> with twelve hundred Horſe, that he ſeized of the King, and the Regent, which were at <hi>Fountainblean,</hi> and that 'twas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly there, that the Declaration of War was made. And this villanous Calumniator hath the boldneſs to tell us, that we were the Aggreſſours in this firſt War, and Aggreſſours in full Peace. It muſt be obſerved here, that this man follows none of the Rules of an Hiſtorian, he generally diſſembles, and paſſes over all thoſe matters of Fact which give light to a Hiſtory, and ſhew the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of an Evil; he inſiſts only on thoſe things by which he may be able to give a very ill aſpect to the Actions of the Proteſtant Party. <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and other Popiſh Writers have not carried their Unfaithfulneſs ſo far.</p>
               <p>The Unfaithfulneſs of <hi>Soulier,</hi> is not greater on occaſion of the ſecond War, which broke the Peace of <hi>Orleans;</hi> We were, ſaith he, in full Peace when we made that hideous Attempt which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Conſpiracy of <hi>Meaux.</hi> Lying coſts this man nothing.

By theſe two Examples we may judge the Fidelity of <hi>Soulier</hi> in the reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which this Prieſt ſays upon occaſion of that which we had ſaid, That in the Year 1659, we were not treated ſo ill, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to a Conſpiracy with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> 'twas that even then the Court deſigned our Ruine, that we knew it well, and that it already appeared by many Declarations which had been publiſhed to our diſadvantage, which he quotes. To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the deſign of the Clergy, was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us, we do not doubt, and that it may be the Court might have the ſame intents and purpoſes; that 'tis true ſome Declarations had been already publiſhed againſt us. But we ſay, That the fear of a future and uncertain Evil, or ſome little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Evils, did never engage us to make uſe of actual Conſpiracies for our Preſervation: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and Decrees which the Clergy obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt us, were as yet nothing, and then did us no Evil. The King himſelf granted us a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod at <hi>Laudun,</hi> in the Year 1659; a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which had not been conceded to us ſince the Year 1641; an evident proof that the Court was not then under thoſe wicked Inclinations, in which it hath been ſince engaged, or at leaſt, if it had already conceived the deſign of deſtroying us, it was not poſſible for us to gueſs at it, ſeeing their actions ſpake the contrary.</p>

This may be ſeen in a Writing made by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Sillon,</hi> to juſtifie the Conduct of Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> his Maſter; and in ſome of the printed Letters of Monſieur <hi>Coſter,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Mans.</hi> This Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> was yet ſo great in 1660, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſon was received at <hi>Amiens,</hi> to whom the publick Exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was allowed in the City: This obliged the General Aſſembly of the Clergy, to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint thereof to the King, and to content them, a Promiſe was made, to give to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> a Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in the Suburbs, there to exerciſe their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

From that time, behold <hi>Richard</hi> attacqued, and yet he enterprizes new Work abroad, which alone required a man, and a whole Kingdom beſides. From the thirteenth of <hi>March</hi> there were great Conteſts in the Parliament, touching the manner how it ought to be compoſed, whether they ſhould there permit two Houſes, the Upper and the Lower; what perſons ought to be received into the Upper Houſe, in caſe they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to ſubſiſt.

                  </list> Was not the Militia in very good ſtate to be tranſported to make an Irruption into a foreign Kingdom beyond the Sea? At the ſame time <hi>Richard</hi> being diſpleaſed with this Parliament, who would have reduced his Authority, to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little thing, diſſolved them in the beginning of the Month of <hi>May;</hi> and three days after, on the fifth of the ſame Month, he publiſhed a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; by which he appointed all ſuſpicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go out of <hi>London,</hi> in three days, and to come no nearer to it, that within twenty Miles. Immediately after the Parliament, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector had aſſembled on the Month of <hi>February,</hi> was diſſolved, on the ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> the old long Parliament aſſembled, and began to ſit on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of the ſame Month: This old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pulled down <hi>Richard,</hi> and appointed, that Monarchical Government ſhould be aboliſhed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Houſe of Lords. It cauſed alſo the Effigies of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> which was at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to be taken away, Fearing, ſay they, leaſt it ſhould give occaſion to ſome popular Commotion in this Conjuncture, and change of Affairs. This is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the time when the Proteſtants of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to introduce the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into the Realm: for the circumſtance of Affairs was altogether fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them: as they had nothing to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, ſo they might ſuccour their good Friends every-where elſe. On the twenty ſecond of <hi>May,</hi> old Stile, the Officers of the Army agreed with the old Parliament, to aboliſh all Title of King, and Protector, and to eſtabliſh the three Nations in a Government intirely Free. On the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:49990:230"/>twenty fourth the Parliament appointed, That no other Seal ſhould be farther made uſe of, but that on the two ſides whereof were engraven the Arms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and cauſed the Seal which <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> made uſe of, to be broken: They named, for the ſpace of many days, thirty one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to make up a new Council of State: 'Twas at this very time, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the beginning of the Month of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year 1659, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Protector, <hi>Richard,</hi> to remove from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> Behold then the three Kingdoms in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Anarchy. Without doubt it was in this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and tranquil Eſtate, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Proteſtants of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> to ſuccour them, provided they would deliver to them all the places whereof they could diſpoſe: To ſpeak ſeriouſly, 'tis unavoidable, that the Forgers of this Piece were the moſt ignorant Bruits that were in the World, or that their Brains were diſordered to that degree, that there was never any thing like it. Let not Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> be diſpleaſed at all this: He hath neither Science nor Knowledge of the matters of the World, nor common Senſe; for if he had one grain of Underſtanding, or good Knowledge, he would never have engaged in ſo durty a Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Let us go on, for this is not all: After we have conſidered the State of Affairs in <hi>England,</hi> let us conſider thoſe of <hi>France:</hi> This Kingdom was in an Eſtate of Proſperity, with reſpect to Affairs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, which would have taken away all thoughts from troubleſome perſons, of making any Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at home, although there ſhould be ſuch which had it in deſign and purpoſe: 'Tis the very Year of the Peace of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> and of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the King. In the beginning of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in the Year 1659, a Suſpenſion of War, by
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:49990:230"/>Sea and Land, was ſigned: that nothing might croſs the Negotiations of Peace, which were already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced very far, Marſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> was gone to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Orders of the King, on the ſubject, of this Suſpenſion. Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> at the ſame time that this pretended Conſpiracy was made in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> paſſed through the Province, to go to the place where the Peace was to be concluded. He arrived the twelfth of <hi>July</hi> at <hi>Libourne,</hi> on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> and at the ſame time their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties parted from <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> to begin their Journey towards the Frontiers of <hi>Spain.</hi> Muſt it not be confeſſed, that the Miniſters and Elders of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> are very cunning at Confederations, and Conſpiracies; that they know admirably well how to take their time, and that no circumſtances could be choſen more favourable to Embroil a Kingdom within, than a time of general Peace, which leaves the King in a condition to fall with all his power upon the Conſpirators? To conclude, Hath <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> no Shame, and will he never cover himſelf with wholſome and ſalutary Confuſion?

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:49990:231"/>thought ſure, that the Impoſtors having heard ſay, that there was in the Province, a Miniſter born a Subject of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> named Monſieur <hi>Durel,</hi> they might very well chooſe this perſon, to make of him a Negotiator with thoſe of his own Nation. <hi>Soulier,</hi> raviſhed to find this paſſage open, to go out of this dirty place, hath ſtooped thereto: Yes, ſays he, 'tis <hi>Durel,</hi> the Copy which was taken from the Original, was ill tranſcribed, they took an <hi>a</hi> for an <hi>u,</hi> and a <hi>t</hi> for an <hi>l,</hi> and whereas <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> in the firſt Act was nothing elſe but a Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between the Miniſters and Elders of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the ſecond Edition, he becomes Aſſiſtant-Moderator, and is ſubſcribed <hi>E.

Therefore I know not what we ſhall do with this capital E. in this Act of <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, unleſs we make an F. of it to find Frier <hi>John</hi> there. But by misfortune Mr. <hi>Durel</hi> was never a Monk.</p>
               <p>Another misfortune for <hi>Soulier,</hi> much greater than the former, is, That <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> was never Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor in the Province of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> nor Deputy in any Synod, he was only Miniſter to <hi>Monſieur</hi> the Duke <hi>de la Force;</hi> he preached indeed at <hi>la Force</hi> when the Duke was there, but he was properly affixed to his perſon and his Family: for which reaſon he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him every-where, and did not belong to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of any of the Provinces. 'Twas one named <hi>Mr. Barte,</hi> who as then Miniſter of the Church <hi>de la Force,</hi> a Member of the Province, and lawful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty to the Synod. 'Tis true, that <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> and was therein favour of one named <hi>Mr. Heſperien,</hi> who was his Friend, and had buſineſs there. And <hi>Mr. Betoule,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Duras,</hi> who was Plaintiff againſt <hi>Mr. Heſperien,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> in the Aſſembly, ſaid to him, <hi>What do you here? you are no Paſtor of the</hi> Lower Guyenne, <hi>nor Deputy to the Synod.</hi> To whom <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> anſwered in theſe very words, <hi>I am no fixed Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:49990:232"/>in any Province; but in all Provinces where the Duke is, I have the honour to aſſist at the Synods which are held during the time of his reſidence there.</hi> The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod took this Remonſtrance into conſideration, and granted to <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> no deciſive Voice, but only Seſſion among them, and a deliberative Voice. The ſaid <hi>Mr. Durel</hi> was never ſeen in any of the Synods of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> but only at this time, and never was ſeen there afterwards. Behold a ſubject well choſen, to make him Aſſiſtant-moderator of a Synod, and the Negociator in a great affair; of a Synod, ſay I, of which he was no Member, where he was no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, where he had no deciſive Voice, and where he had never appeared before. Behold therefore a new <hi>Errata</hi> of the third Edition of the Act of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier.</hi> It may not be doubted that the Art of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> which hath made him find <hi>Durel</hi> in <hi>Daret,</hi> will alſo make him find <hi>Dorde</hi> in <hi>Durel.</hi> But we do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe him, that this new Correction will be of no ſervice to him; for when <hi>Durel</hi> ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and <hi>Dorde</hi> put in the place thereof, all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine will be overturned: we ſhall have no <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> proper to negociate with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> no man unfixed from any Church, and by conſequence fit to employ his time in Negotiations; no man which was oftentimes in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in <hi>Normandy,</hi> places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to entertain Gorreſpondence with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> All this was found in <hi>Mr. Durel,</hi> for which reaſon they judged it fit to make him the Negociator, and afterwards Aſſiſtant-moderator. But poor <hi>Mr. Dorde</hi> was a Miniſter of the Province, ſerving in a little Town or Village of <hi>Perigort,</hi> very far from the Sea, without Commerce, without all advantage to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Correſpondencies, not ſtirring from his place, affixed to a Congregation made up of perſons very unfit to furniſh means of Negociating Treaties. In good earneſt, behold a heap of croſs Accidents for
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:49990:232"/>
                  <hi>Mr. Soulier.</hi> Is not a man very unhappy, when he would edifie the Church by a pious Deceit, to find ſo many ſtumbling-blocks in his way?</p>
               <p>To ſtrengthen this Argument, we added a matter of fact, notorious to all thoſe who had never ſo little knowledge of <hi>Mr. Durel,</hi> viz. that there was not a man amongſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had a greater hatred for the Parliament than he. So that it was to loſe all ſenſe, to chuſe this perſon to treat with them of a Conſpiracy againſt <hi>France.</hi> This matter of Fact is notorious, and 'tis known by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, that the King of <hi>England</hi> lookt upon him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as one that had ſuffered exile for his ſake, and recompenſed him not only with the Deanary of <hi>Windſor,</hi> but with many other Benefices which he had given him before that. To this the Prieſt <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> anſwers, A very fine thing 'tis that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was then dead; and that though <hi>Durel</hi> were an Enemy to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> it doth not follow that he was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his Son, and to thoſe that then ruled among the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> That is to ſay, that <hi>Mr. Durel,</hi> who had a general indignation againſt the Enemies of his King, reconciled himſelf to them, as ſoon as they had loſt their Head, and joyned another party to them to betray another King, into whoſe Country he was fled for refuge. This is very well contrived. He adds to this a Letter from <hi>Mr. de Vane</hi> a Gentleman belonging to the Queen Dowager of <hi>England,</hi> who ſays, <hi>That the Deanary of</hi> Windſor <hi>was not given to Mr.</hi> Durel <hi>to recompenſe his fidelity, but to diſcharge a Debt of</hi> 2000 l. <hi>Sterling, which was owing to him by my Lord of</hi> Mancheſter. As we have not the honour to know <hi>Mr. de Vane,</hi> ſo we ſhall leave his Teſtimony to ſignifie according to its worth. We ſhall only ſay, that the Deanary of <hi>Windſor</hi> is at the Nomination and Diſpoſal of the King, and not in the Diſpoſal of the Counts of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> and that 'tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:49990:233"/>that the King, at the ſollicitation of the Lord <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> ſhould give a Benefice of that importance to a man who was not known to be a zealous Friend to the Royal Family. Seeing we are now ſhewing the Falſhoods of this Act, and the ignorance of thoſe who framed it, we muſt not forget that theſe men make <hi>Ricottier</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Clairac.</hi> By conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Table of the names of thoſe who appeared at this Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> it may be ſeen that <hi>Ricottier</hi> being Miniſter of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and not of <hi>Clairac,</hi> he could have no other Title, ſeeing he appeared at the Synod on the behalf of the Church which he then ſerved. It muſt be confeſſed, that never were there ſo many Falſhoods heaped together.</p>
               <p>For a Fifth Argument, we produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Marginal Note of Mr. <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A fifth Argument of Falſhood: <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi>'s Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereon.</note> Cromwel <hi>was yet alive.</hi> Now he had been dead almoſt a year. To this he anſwers, that he might ſay that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was yet alive, <hi>For that could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to any one but his Son, which ſucceeded him in the Government.</hi> For this I remit him to the Letter of Mr. <hi>Le Feure,</hi> which we have ſeen above. This is curious, and will give very fair advantage to the Learned to reſolve the difficulties of Hiſtory. <hi>Such a one was yet alive,</hi> 'tis true; he was dead ſome ten years ſince, but that ſignifies nothing, his Son was alive, and reigned in his ſtead: 'Tis the ſame thing. At the moſt, ſays Mr. <hi>Soulier,</hi> this can be no more than a miſtake of the Hiſtorian, which cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the truth of the Act, which ſpeaks not of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> or his Son, but of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in general: By your favour, Mr. <hi>Soulier,</hi> 'tis a great prejudice to the Act: For if it had been made whilſt <hi>Cromwel</hi> lived, it would have been much more probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis known that <hi>Cromwel</hi> did very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:49990:233"/>himſelf, or appeared ſo to do in the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reformed Churches of <hi>France.</hi> Beſides, his Throne was ſo well eſtabliſhed at home, that he could attempt any thing abroad. 'Tis alſo known that <hi>France</hi> never feared any man ſo much as He. So that whilſt he lived, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were in condition to attempt, and it may be to execute the Project which they charge upon them; but after his death it was no longer ſo, the Scene changed from white to black. If the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> did put <hi>Cromwel</hi> in the Margin, under this apprehenſion, as it's very probable he did, this makes it appear, that he was not altogether a Beaſt. He thought it was much more reaſonable to make the Miniſters of <hi>Guyenne</hi> treat with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> than with that Chaos of Government that came after him; there was only this little difficulty in the way, that <hi>Cromwel</hi> was dead. But this is a ſmall matter with theſe Gentlemen, who have done in our days that which we thought impoſſible.</p>

                  <note place="margin">A ſixth Argument of Falſhood: the leud Anſwer, of <hi>Soulier.</hi>
                  </note>Among the Arguments, we ſaid, that it was to invent without judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſuppoſe that an affair of this nature could be treated of in a Synod, where there was a hundred and fifty Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it was to put a Rope about all their necks, and deliver their lives into the firſt Fool or Traytor. To this he anſwers, what he had already anſwered elſewhere, <hi>'Tis that there is nothing more eaſie than to cauſe an Act to be ſigned by thoſe who preſide in theſe Aſſemblies, without paſſing it by a plurality of Voices; and above all, then when the Moderator is in the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as he was upon this occaſion, where</hi> Ricottier <hi>was one of the principal Inſtruments thereof.</hi> But this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reaſoning like <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, and like Doctor <hi>Shoemaker.</hi> We are not diſputing about ſigning an Act, or cauſing it to be ſigned. We know very
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:49990:234"/>well, that nothing is more eaſie, than to get Acts ſigned by the Preſidents in a Chimney-corner: That which is diſputed, is about the execution of an Act, and of putting it into a condition to be executed. For this 'tis neceſſary not only that it paſs all the Voices of the Synod, but alſo that it be debated and conſidered in all the Conſiſtories; otherwiſe the Signatures of <hi>Ricottier,</hi> and three others, would ſerve as little to give aſſurance to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> for the pretended delivering up of places, as the word of the poor men of the Hoſpital of <hi>Quinzevint</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> Now we demand once more, whether in ſuch a time as this, there were men fooliſh enough to make ſuch a deliberation paſs before a thouſand or twelve hundred perſons? for there were not leſs in all the Conſiſtories of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> Surely this were to expoſe their lives at a very cheap price.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A ſeventh Argument of Falſhood; and the Fooleries that <hi>Soulier</hi> ſpeaks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>For a new Argument, we had ſaid, that theſe men of <hi>Montpazier</hi> had loſt their ſenſe, to engage to deliver places to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the year 1659. when for almoſt forty years they had had no places or Town which they could deliver to Strangers. <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt makes very judicious Reflections thereon. Firſt he ſaith that they make this Act ſpeak what they pleaſe, to render it ridiculous; <hi>But the men of the Synod did not engage preciſely by this Act to deliver places to the</hi> Engliſh. We know not whether this man dotes, or hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make himſelf ridiculous. The men of the Synod did not promiſe to deliver places; what then do thoſe words ſignifie? <hi>The</hi> Engliſh <hi>require that we give them aſſurance to put into their poſſeſſion all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Town whereof we can diſpoſe.</hi> What did the Synod thereupon? <hi>It gave command to Mr.</hi> Durel <hi>to know what aſſurances they deſired;</hi> and of what? of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49990:234"/>the delivery of places? for there was nothing elſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſpute. At the ſame time they give order, <hi>To promiſe on our part all the aſſurances that were poſſible.</hi> I underſtand not the Language of the Synod of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier,</hi> if this be not in formal words to promiſe the delivering up of places: ſo then in deſpite to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Mr. <hi>Soulier,</hi> behold four or five Miniſters, and it may be ſo many Elders, promiſe to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> to deliver them <hi>Bourdeaux, Blage,</hi> &amp;c. and other places of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> In truth, this is ſo abſurd, that the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> cannot hinder himſelf from ſeeing the abſurdity thereof; and for that reaſon he gives a ridiculous gloſs to this Act. The ſecond thing which <hi>Soulier</hi> anſwers, is, that we need not be ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that this Act took no effect: the Act, ſays he, was in the month of <hi>July,</hi> in the years 1659. Now immediately after two things happened, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the execution; the one was the Peace of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> the other, that the Miniſter <hi>Durel</hi> arriving in <hi>England,</hi> found many differing Factions there. But Mr. <hi>Soulier</hi> ought to remember, that the two things, which according to him hindered the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, ought to have hindered the project, and the deliberation: for they happened not after, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We have made it appear that theſe Factions happened in <hi>England</hi> immediately after the death of <hi>Cromwel;</hi> and for the Peace of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> it's true, it was concluded after; but the Negotiation thereof was begun, and the ſucceſs certain, many months before the Synod of <hi>Montpazier.</hi> The third Anſwer of <hi>Soulier,</hi> is taken from a Book intituled, <hi>The laſt Efforts of afflicted Innocency:</hi> Where to that which the Author objects, that the Hugenot party was in no condition to make themſelves feared, he anſwers, <hi>Remember what the Poet ſaid,</hi> Furor arma miniſtrat; <hi>Fury finds Arms, and when they have no Cities, they will take them.</hi> There is ſome probability
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:49990:235"/>that Mr. <hi>Soulier</hi> knows how to read Latin, for he hath tranſcribed three words thereof, and this makes much to his honour againſt the Accuſation of his Maſter <hi>Meſnier,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Le Feure.</hi> We anſwer to Mr. <hi>Soulier,</hi> that we cannot warrant all the thoughts of other men; but though it ſhould be true that there were yet ſome reaſon to fear the Reformed, as much abaſed, and ſubjected as they are, becauſe Fury furniſhes Arms, yet there was no reaſon to fear them in the time of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then there was nothing which might move their Rage. Lambs become Lions, when they are run againſt the Walls. The deſpair into which they thruſt the Reformed, might indeed have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with Arms, if God had not prevented thoſe unhappy Commotions. But it was impoſſible that the condition in which they were in 1659. ſhould put them into that deſpair, which puts them upon any thing, and makes them ſometimes ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful therein.</p>

                  <note place="margin">An tighth Argument of Falſhood; and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against the Wrangles of <hi>Soulier.</hi>
                  </note>We drew an invincible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Falſhood, againſt this wicked Piece, from the Silence of the Court: The King knew many Years ſince, by the means of <hi>Joly</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> and the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillion,</hi> That they had formed a horrid Conſpiracy in <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne,</hi> againſt his State; he knew the Authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they were yet alive, but he ſaid nothing of it, he did not chaſtiſe thoſe who had made this bold Attempt: He complained not of it any where; and from whence comes this Spirit of Patience? Have they forgiven the leaſt fault to the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the ſpace of twenty Years? Have they not laid to their charge, a thouſand falſe Crimes? Have they not had an open Ear for all their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſors?
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49990:235"/>Have they not puniſhed them ſeverely for Faults falſely imputed, and ill proved? And would they neglect the puniſhment of Treaſon, in him that was Principal therein; who will believe it, and whom can <hi>Soulier</hi> perſwade of the truth of it? Beſides, at what time was this? Obſerve, it was at a time in which they had ſworn the Ruine of the Proteſtants; in which they earneſtly wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find them culpable; in which they did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all that can be imagined, to make them ſo: Was there any thing ſo much deſired by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the Court, as to have a ſmall occaſion to ſay, <hi>Seeing that our ſaid Subjects have always perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a Spirit of Faction and Rebellion, even in the times when they intirely enjoyed our Favour, under the benefits of our Edicts, as appears by the Conſpiracy of</hi> Montpazier. This would have been convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſerted in the Edict which revokes that of <hi>Nantes:</hi> but there is nothing like it ſeen there; they give no other reaſon there, But <hi>that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and the best part of our Subjects, of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Proteſtant Religion, had embraced the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſo that the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>and all that had been granted in favour of the ſaid Reformed Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, continues to no purpoſe.</hi> It is very much wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Obſervation, that only two Years before, in the time when the utter Deſtruction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed was reſolved, the King gives a publick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to their-Fidelity; 'tis in the Act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, granted to the pretended Rebels of <hi>Dauphine:</hi> that is to ſay, to thoſe poor Men who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pray to GOD upon the Ruine of their Churches, without doing injury to any one, but alſo without deſires of being troubled there. The King, ſay I, in the Oblivion which he granted to theſe men, ſays, <hi>The immoveable Fidelity of all our other Subjects of the ſaid Religion, hath inclined us rather to
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:49990:236"/>entertain thoughts of Clemency, than of Rigour towards the Guilty.</hi> How could it be, that the Court ſhould have ſuch apprehenſions of the Fidelity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the Kingdom, if it had in its hand an Act capable of convincing them of deſiring to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Kingdom as a prey to Strangers? And if it had them not, but knew well the Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> and gave credit to it, what could oblige it to inſert a Clauſe ſo falſe in this Act of Oblivion? I know very well, that Kings in theſe fort of Acts pretend themſelves ſatisfied oftentimes with perſons which they do commend, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeaſon when they are leaſt ſatisfied with them. But it is when there is ſomething to fear: 'tis when they would oblige men to lay down their Arms, who are in a condition to make themſelves fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when actually, and indeed they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of them. But, I intreat you, what is it that the King, with 200000 Men in Arms, without any foreign Wars, hath to fear of a thouſand or twelve hundred Peaſants of <hi>Dauphine, Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Ceven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> of whom they had already maſſacred more than two thirds? If <hi>Soulier</hi> can reconcile this with a pretended perſwaſion, that the Court hath of the truth of the Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> he will do us a kindneſs to do it: But, ſaith he, <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which they draw from the ſilence of the Court, is no proof, that it doubts the truth of this Act: the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which the King hath given me of defending my ſelf, and maintaining it, is an indiſputable proof; that his Majeſty doth not doubt thereof.</hi> A very fine proof! The King hath permitted <hi>Soulier</hi> to defend this Piece, therefore it is true, and he believes 'tis ſo. Firſt, the King it may be knows not who this <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> is, and 'tis known that theſe kind of Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions paſs by the means of a Father Confeſſour, or ſome other Eccleſiaſtick, who ſays concerning it,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:49990:236"/>what he pleaſes, being much aſſured, that he ſhall never be reprehended for it. Beſides, behold a great Wonder, that they ſuffer ſuch a man as <hi>Soulier</hi> is to hazard his Reputation: If he ſucceed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade this pretended Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> with good luck, the Court will always gain thereby; and 'twill be a reaſon and pretence to juſtifie its Conduct. If he does not ſucceed therein, the ſhame will remain upon him alone; no name or perſon of Quality appears therein, the hurt will not be great. 'Tis thus that men reaſon naturally in the World: So that the Permiſſion which the Court gives him, to defend the truth of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, is ſo far from being a mark of the value they have for him, that 'tis a proof they look on him as a Wretch which they abandon, and leave as forlorn. Let him ſhew us any man of Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which joyns with him in this Cauſe. There is nothing more pleaſant, than to ſee the Value and Reputation which this Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf: <hi>He demanded leave from the Court,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to defend himſelf, and the King was pleaſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</hi> And ſpeaking of an Author which goes for a perſon a little more able than he, <hi>If this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expects I ſhould do him the Honour of Anſwering him.</hi> This makes a man ſmile; and he can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear to remember the Leſſon which his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Father <hi>Meſnier,</hi> gave him, Let every one meddle with his own Trade: <hi>Ne Sutor ultra Crepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; Let not the Cobler go beyond his Last.</hi> I never knew thoſe Authors, which took it for an Honour to have ſuch an Antagoniſt: Firſt, a Lacque; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a ſorry Mechanick; thirdly, a ſmall Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary, though in the laſt place, he be Monſieur the Abbot, for men aſcend by a criminal Ability more eaſily, than by a true Merit. But let us go on, ſince
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:49990:237"/>we have begun, and ſee what he ſays to prove the truth of his Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thoſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which are accuſed to have Signed this Act, find themſelves as Innocent, as this Author would perſwade us, how comes it to paſs, that they have not attempted it, ſince the time that my Book appeared in the World?</hi> We have already anſwered to this: How, and before whom could they provide for the maintenance of their Innocencie, ſeeing there was no Judge to receive their Complaints, nor Notary who dared to receive their Proteſtations, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Bailiff that dare ſignifie the leaſt thing on their behalf? <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt knows this, the thing is of publick Notoriety, and he hath the boldneſs to draw advantage from a Silence forced, and which was impoſſible to be broken. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Gentlemen ſpeak when they can ſpeak; and I pray take the pains to hear them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Act:</p>

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49990:237"/>1659, which Monſieur <hi>Soulier</hi> has produced in his Hiſtory of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> at <hi>p.</hi> 552, of the <hi>Paris</hi> Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, containing in ſubſtance, That the Miniſters and Elders of <hi>Lower Guyenne,</hi> aſſembled in Synod at the ſaid <hi>Montpazier,</hi> had made an Act to call the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their Help, and ſollicite them to Arms for the Defence of their perſecuted Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: Upon which Monſieur <hi>Joſeph Aſimont,</hi> after he had read, and conſidered exactly the Tenour of the ſaid Act, did ſay, That indeed he remembers that he was choſen to draw up the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> but at the ſame time doth Proteſt, and that with an Oath before GOD, who ſearches the Hearts, and as if he actually ſtood before the Tribunal of JESUS CHRIST, who muſt Judge the Living and the Dead, That he, the firſt Deponent, never drew up, nor ſigned the ſaid Act; and that he never heard any thing ſpoken of it, till ſince the ſaid <hi>Soulier</hi> inſerted it in his Writings; and that therefore it is a Piece forged by a Spirit of Lies; and he calls the GOD of Truth to be both Witneſs and Judge of this Impoſture, which bears in its own Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, the marks of its Falſhood; foraſmuch as the ſaid Act is ſaid to be Signed by <hi>Durel,</hi> Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, which is notoriouſly falſe, as may be ſeen by the Papers of the Acts of the Synod, which were put into the hands of Monſieur <hi>de Villefran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che de Vivans,</hi> who aſſiſted there on the behalf of the King, and which Monſieur <hi>de Villefranche</hi> ſent to the King's Council, according to the Cuſtom.

               <p>As to the Form, nothing can be found to object againſt this Proteſtation: It was received not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Notaries, but by the chief Magiſtrate of the moſt conſiderable City of the Country, and is ſealed with the Common Seal thereof. As to the Sincerity of thoſe who proteſt, and atteſt it, he muſt have renounced all Modeſty, 'who ſhall call it in doubt: They are perſons that are in a place of ſecurity, who have almoſt nothing more
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49990:239"/>to hope, or fear from <hi>France:</hi> it cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that men would damn themſelves by ſuch an Oath as this, for the maintenance of a Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. If the Accuſation were true, why do they not permit <hi>Soulier,</hi> and his Book, to paſs without ſaying any thing to it? What great good can come to them hence forward, when they ſhall have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated in the minds of the Publick, the opinion that there was a true Conſpiracy at <hi>Montpazier?</hi> If the Affairs of the Reformed were in ſound and good condition in <hi>France,</hi> they might ſay, That by this falſe Oath, they have been deſirous to prevent the Evils that ſuch a thing, if it were believed, might draw upon the whole Body, and alſo every ſingle Member of it: but at preſent, when the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of our Ruine is conſummate, muſt he not have the Soul of a Devil, and be willing to damn himſelf out of humour, by engaging the name of God, and thoſe which bear his Image upon Earth, to maintain a Lye which he knows to be a Lye, and a Lye from which very little good can come, in compariſon of the evil? The pleaſure of making <hi>Soulier</hi> paſs for an Impoſtor, is not (I think) great enough to be willing to purchaſe it by Perjury. When <hi>Soulier,</hi> and his Companions Forged this Act, they were ſupported in their Crime by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the great advantage which was to come (according to them) to the Catholick Church, by haſtning the Ruine of the Hereticks in <hi>France.</hi> But behold men who commit a crime by an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Perjury, without being ſuported by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any profit or intereſt: Can this enter into the mind of any man of ſound ſenſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? Behold then four irreprovable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, who aſſiſted at the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> who atteſt the Falſhood of the Hiſtory in all its parts; who ſay that <hi>Durel</hi> or <hi>Daret</hi> were no Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49990:239"/>in this Synod; that <hi>Saint Blancard</hi> was not Commiſſary, but <hi>Villefranche</hi> of <hi>Vivans;</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of like nature did paſs in the Synod againſt the Service of the King: But behold in particular, this Monſieur <hi>Aſimont,</hi> who was Secretary to the Synod, he who by conſequence muſt be privy to the buſineſs, who muſt have digeſted the pieces that were drawn up, and who did really Sign the Act, as the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> pretends: 'tis this <hi>Aſimont</hi> to whom <hi>Soulier</hi> addreſſes himſelf in particular: <hi>As to what reſpects the Signatures, and the Subſcriptions of the Miniſter</hi> Aſimont, <hi>and the Secretary</hi> Meyzonet, ſaith he, <hi>I know them ſo well, and they are ſo conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to other Acts which they have ſigned, that I aſſure myſelf they will not dare to diſavow it: However, it will be very eaſie for me to convince them by other Acts which they have ſigned; the Miniſter</hi> Aſimont <hi>may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Conference that we had in the City of</hi> Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, <hi>in the Dioceſs of</hi> Sorlat, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1657, <hi>and that the Original, ſigned by him, at the foot of all his anſwers, is remaining in my hands.</hi> If any honeſt men have a deſire to compare the Signature of the Act of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> with the true Signatures and Subſcriptions of Monſieur <hi>Aſimont,</hi> they will ſee them very true, and very well atteſted; and till then, ſeeing the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> appeals to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Miniſter <hi>Aſimont,</hi> and to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Eymet,</hi> I am of opinion we ought to hear Monſieur <hi>Aſimont</hi> himſelf in particular.</p>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49990:240"/>my Papers in <hi>France,</hi> to make it appear, that he has the gift of Impudence in the higheſt degree, and cannot forbear Lying, ſince he there gives himſelf the Lye by a groſs and manifeſt Contradiction: but I fear this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was burnt with many others, as well as my Books: But for want of this Piece, which would render him unworthy of all Belief: I can ſay, to juſtifie myſelf from the Accuſation, by which he charges me to have ſigned an Act of ſecret Correſpondence with the Enemies of the State, That I have been ſo far from being ſuſpected of Unfaithfulneſs to the King, that ſome of my Brethren grew jealous of me in their own minds, by the very cloſe adherence which I teſtified to his Service in the Civil Wars, and by reaſon of a Letter under the Great Seal, which his Majeſty cauſed to be written to me in the Year <hi>1654,</hi> to aſſure me, That he took in good part my Fidelity and Zeal, with aſſurance of Recompence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Merits, when occaſion ſhould be offered to him. By the Grace of God I never deſired, nor cauſed it to be requeſted of him, although occaſions thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves unto me: This Letter could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me from divers Decrees of Impriſonment, which the Parliament of <hi>Guyenne</hi> did afterwards grant againſt me, for the cauſe of my Religion, nor from the Decree of the Intendant of <hi>Ageſſeau,</hi> for preaching in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den places, by the order of the Synod; nor from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and Quartering of Souldiers, appointed by the Intendant of <hi>Ris,</hi> becauſe, going from <hi>Bergerac,</hi> I wrote to one of my Friends, That I went away becauſe I would not ſee the Abomination of Deſolation, which was about to fall upon this Church. God hath beſtowed on me the Mercy of eſcaping happily out of theſe troubleſome Affairs, by manifeſting the Integrity of my Conduct, and the Sincerity of my Intentions. 'Tis true, at last, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I could not ſerve two Maſters, in <hi>France,</hi> who were of ſuch contrary Sentiments, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>1683,</hi> three Paſs-ports, for myſelf, and two Sons, both Miniſters, (by Monſieur of <hi>Corbichet,</hi> heretofore the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the Duke <hi>de la Force,</hi> and who was then in the Service of Monſieur the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them with great eaſe) to allow me the liberty of going out of the Kingdom. From whence I reaſon thus againſt <hi>Soulier:</hi> If the King, having been informed of the pretended Act of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> had given credit to the Accuſor, would he ſo eaſily have granted my Paſs-port, before our general Baniſhment? Is it credible he would have permitted a Miniſter convinced of Rebellion againſt his Majeſty, and of Conſpiracy againſt the State, to go out of his Kingdom? He who had kept in Priſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> for Preaching or Praying after the Prohibitions, would he have given the Keys of the Gates to a Miniſter known guilty, not only of the ſame faults, but of a crime worthy of the ſevereſt Puniſhment? Certainly there is nothing could have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected me, and I muſt have expected to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to Priſon, or to the Gallies for ever: Seeing therefore, that after the ſight of this Act, he gave me my Paſs-port, and was content with my Baniſhment, as well as with that of others, 'tis an indiſputable proof, that he gave no credit to it, and knew the Falſhood thereof, only he thought fit to leave <hi>Soulier</hi> at liberty to fight us with the Weapons of his Tongue and Pen. To conclude, though we have to do with a King who hath condemned his Faithful Subjects to Baniſhment, even thoſe who expoſed their Goods, their Lives, and Liberties to his Service, yet I do not repent the performance of my Duty; 'tis matter of Confidence to me, and gives me the boldneſs to implore the Protection of GOD against the Cruelty of Men.</p>

Two things are conſiderable in this Teſtimony of Monſieur <hi>Aſimont;</hi> the firſt is, That he is a man of great Age, and of whom it may be ſaid, that he expects the moment in which he muſt go and appear before God. Can any one believe that a man ſo near to leave the World, ſhould be willing to keep meaſures with it, for the preſervation of I know not what trifle of Honour and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that being ſo near his appearance before God, ſhould dare to prophane his holy Name by ſo many Falſhoods and Perjuries? The other thing obſervable is, The Circumſtance which he obſerves in his Letter, concerning the ſuſpicion, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, under which he fell, in the minds of ſome of his Brethren, by reaſon of a certain Letter of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and Thanks, which the King cauſed to be written to him, as an Acknowledgment of his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his Service. This is notorious, and all the World knows it. Is there any probability, that they would truſt ſuch a man with a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, which they knew to have been ſo faithful, and ſo perfectly in the Intereſts of the Court? But is there any probability, that a man who had been ſo faithful to the King, and ſo faſt and ſure to his Service, would have any part in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy and Conſpiracy? I do acknowledge, that I have no more to ſay after this, and that if the Prieſt <hi>Soulier</hi> does continue to maintain his Act, and Conſpiracy of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> he may very well boaſt, that he hath the gift of Impudence to the higheſt degree and meaſure: For never had Romance and Fiction, ſo many marks of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Let us ſee them a little altogether.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ricottier</hi> is here Miniſter of <hi>Clairac;</hi> and in truth he was Miniſter of the Reformed Church of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</hi>

To <hi>Durel,</hi> who treated with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they give the name of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah,</hi> or <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> or <hi>Eſay,</hi> or ſome ſuch name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with an <hi>E;</hi> and yet his name was <hi>John.</hi> 6. <hi>Durel</hi> is preſent, he receives the Act, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he was not ſo much as deputed to the Synod. 7. <hi>Durel</hi> treated with <hi>Cromewell,</hi> who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had been dead ten Months. 8. <hi>Durel</hi> treated with the Parliamentarians, to whom he was a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemy, and by whom he was mortally hated. 9. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> offer to enter <hi>France</hi> with their Arms, in a time when they were in the greateſt Confuſion among themſelves, in an Anarchy, and by conſequence in a ſtate of the utmoſt weakneſs. 10. A Conſpiracy is diſcovered to the Court, part of the Authors are living, and the Court ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof. 11. <hi>Aſimont,</hi> one of the principal Conſpirators, begs leave for himſelf and his two Sons, to depart the Kingdom, 'tis granted him without any difficulty. 12. They ſuppreſs the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> they Perſecute the Reformed even to death, without objecting this Conſpiracy as a fault unto them. 13. Men enterprize and attempt to deliver places to an Enemy, which they have not had in their hands theſe fifty Years. 14. Men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to raiſe a Civil War in the time of the Peace of the <hi>Pyreneans,</hi> at a ſeaſon when the Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without any trouble from abroad. 15. They are four or five Miniſters, and it may be as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elders, which make this Conſpiracy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:49990:242"/>to execute this great Deſign without commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating it to any one. 16. Or they did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate a Secret on which the Lives of an infinite number of perſons depended, to an hundred and fifty Deputies, yea, to all the Conſiſtories. 17. To conclude, the Reformed attempted to trouble a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and themſelves in a time when they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very great Peace. I do maintain, that here are a heap of Falſhoods, Contradictions, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ſo plain, and ſenſible, that a man muſt have a head and heart made like thoſe of <hi>Soulier</hi> the Prieſt, to be able to digeſt them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, let us ſee a little the Channels by which this Piece hath paſſed, and Providence will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhew us new Indications of Falſhood: As to its ſource, 'tis ſufficiently difficult to diſcover it; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Soulier,</hi> this Act made by the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> is put into the hands of the Miniſter <hi>Vignier; Vignier</hi> died in the Year 1666, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, committed this Piece in truſt, into the hands of <hi>Mounier,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Nerac</hi> alſo, and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league; the Miniſter <hi>Mounier</hi> turns <hi>Catholick</hi> in the Year 1675, and dies in the Year 1677, at <hi>Paris,</hi> in an Inn near the Houſe of <hi>Soiſſons.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Queſne,</hi> Arch-Deacon, and Vicar-General of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> goes to ſee him in the time of his Sickneſs, he gives him this Act of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Queſne</hi> gives it Monſieur <hi>Joly,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Agen, Joly</hi> gives it to Monſieur the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillion,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Bouillion</hi> gives it to the King, and at laſt the King gives it to Monſieur <hi>Chaſteau-neuf,</hi> who puts it in his Office, where it is ſealed up, and joyned to the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a great many hands which are either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, or ſuſpected by us. As to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter <hi>Mounier,</hi> we do continue to ſay, he was a man wounded in his Reputation, by Suſpenſion
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49990:243"/>from his Miniſtry, he was beſides an Apoſtate from the Truth, and had the Character of all voluntary Apoſtates, <hi>i. e.</hi> hatred for the Truth, and for thoſe which do profeſs it.</p>
               <p>But there is in this place one circumſtance ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to convince theſe Villains of their Knavery, that a man cannot eſcape the ſight thereof, The Miniſter <hi>Vignier</hi> died in the year 1666, as <hi>Soulier</hi> himſelf ſays: Why did he, when he was about to die, give this Act of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> as a thing in truſt? To what could this Act ſerve? It was ſeven years ſince that this pretended Conſpiracy with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> was made; the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> had intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed their face, the King was reſtored, and at War with the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> every one knows he was ſo far from entring Leagues in favour of the Proteſtants, that on the contrary, he rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt them. There was not a man living in the World, upon whom they could caſt their eyes to accompliſh the Conſpiracy, but <hi>Cromewell,</hi> or the Parliamentarians: this Piece therefore was abſolutely on one hand of no uſe, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, 'twas capable of deſtroying an infinite number of ſingle perſons, and the whole intire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Reformed in <hi>France:</hi> Monſieur <hi>Vignier</hi> therefore, when he was dying, loſt his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Charity itſelf, to be willing to preſerve a Paper which was good for nothing, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Brethren; a Piece which ought to have been burnt, and which he ſhould have burnt when he was dying. The father we look into this thing, the more we find that theſe Villains were ſmitten with a Spirit of Blindneſs, in all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Fiction.</p>
               <p>As to the Biſhop of <hi>Agen,</hi> he was a Court Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, which had always a thouſand good reaſons to continue at <hi>Paris</hi> about the Affairs of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49990:243"/>I have had a long time in my hands a Letter of Monſieur the Procurator-General, who appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the name of the King, in a manner very rough and harſh, ſpeedily to put an end to his Non reſidence, and to return to his Dioceſs, whither he went very ſeldom. Theſe ſort of men are always at watch, that they may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to produce, which may make them ſtay at the Court, where they are willing to be, that they may be always ready to hunt after a Benefice greater than their own. As to Monſieur <hi>de Queſne,</hi> Vicar-General to the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> we know him not: he may ſay true, and yet all that we have ſaid, receive no blemiſh nor diſadvantage thereby; he might really receive the Piece from <hi>Mounier,</hi> a revolted Miniſter: <hi>Mounier</hi> might be the man that forget it. And that which I find moſt probable is, that <hi>Soulier</hi> and <hi>Mounier</hi> are the two Authors of it: <hi>Soulier</hi> was at the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> he rejoyces to produce an Affair which paſſed there, in a Synod where he was. <hi>Mounier,</hi> principal Author of the Falſhood, might furniſh the Names, he inſerted that of <hi>Durel,</hi> as a perſon proper to Negotiate with the <hi>Engliſh. Soulier,</hi> who knew not Monſieur <hi>Durel,</hi> reading over the Act forged between them, read <hi>Daret.</hi> And 'tis prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that 'twas he who made him Aſſiſtant-Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, at the foot of the Act, for <hi>Mounier</hi> would never have committed ſo groſs a fault. <hi>Soulier</hi> had a Conference with Monſieur <hi>Aſimont,</hi> the Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, above all, thoſe of the parts and ſtrength of <hi>Soulier,</hi> who knew neither Divinity nor Language, receive nothing but confuſion from thoſe Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and they always carry a mortal hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Miniſters that do confound them, with deſign to revenge themſelves at any rate. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49990:244"/>
                  <hi>Aſimont</hi> had been really Secretary to draw up the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> for which reaſon this Synod was to be choſen rather than another, that the Miniſter <hi>Aſimont</hi> might be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed for the trouble which he had put this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonary to, in the Conference. This Act was put into the hands of the King, the King delivered it to Monſieur <hi>Chaſteau-neuf.</hi> Neither the one nor the other made any account of it, becauſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Chaſteau-neuf,</hi> who had the true Acts of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pazier,</hi> ſaw no conformity betwixt them, neither in the Commiſſary, nor in the Aſſiſtant; beſides that, the Piece bore many other Characters of Falſhood: Nevertheleſs it is kept in the Office, as they keep a thouſand and a thouſand falſe Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſuch places. For example, the Cheſts of the Evidences of Abbies are inexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of forged Pieces. Monſieur <hi>de Launoy</hi> hath given us notice thereof ſome-where on the ſubject of the Abby of Saint <hi>Dennis,</hi> by reaſon of the Pieces which <hi>Doublet</hi> hath produced in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Saint <hi>Dennis.</hi> And ſaving the reſpect which is due to the King, and his Library, 'tis full of falſe Manuſcripts. For example, the Jeſuite <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier,</hi> the Prieſt <hi>Soulier,</hi> and Doctor <hi>le Feure,</hi> do ſay, that they have drawn from that Library, the Secret Articles of the Edict of 1577, in one of which 'tis ſaid, The King permits to the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> the Exerciſe of Religion in his Houſe upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> yea, although he himſelf were abſent. Nevertheleſs 'tis certain, that there never was in the Houſe of Monſieur the Prince, any Land which bore the name <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> upon <hi>Loire,</hi> and that there is not any City or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of this name upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> from its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain till it enters the Sea. Let this be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:49990:244"/>by the by, That we may know what account we ought to make of the Manuſcripts of the King's Library, which <hi>Soulier</hi> quotes ſo often. Men throw into theſe Repoſitories all Pieces that go up and down, whether they be true or falſe; the true, fifty Years hence, will be ſo confounded with the falſe, that nothing will be certainly known. Fifty Years hence the Act of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> well kept in the Office of Monſieur <hi>Chaſteau-neuf,</hi> will be as good as if it were true. Behold how things go! If the Son of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mounier</hi> (at preſent Canon of <hi>Tarbies</hi>) be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that we make ſuch a Knave of his Father, he ought not to accuſe us, who do not make men, but take them as they are. As to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he hath written for the Juſtification of his Father, 'tis evident, that 'tis worſe than nothing in the preſent Affair; his Teſtimony is of no weight, and henceforth 'twill be his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to retract it, unleſs he will have his Father paſs for the moſt profligate of all Men. For if it be true, as he would have it be believed, that his Father put this Piece into the hands of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Queſne,</hi> 'tis unavoidable, that he was the Forger of it, it being certain, as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, that the Piece is falſe, and that he could not receive it from Monſieur <hi>Vignier.</hi> So that 'tis no officious Lye in favour of his Father, 'tis an Act the moſt wounding to his Reputation, that could be produced againſt him.</p>
               <p>We will ſtop here, becauſe we have impos'd a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon ourſelves to ſpeak nothing but of the Act of the Synod of <hi>Montpazier,</hi> for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we will not refute all the Calumnies of <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,</hi> nor repel all the Injuries which he ſpeaks

            <p>WE have been obliged to interrupt the ſubject of our <hi>Paſtoral Letters,</hi> to refute a heinous Calumny caſt upon one of our Synods, and which reflects upon the whole Body. At this time we take again our matter and our order: we remember that the laſt Article of Antiquity which we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was that of the Invocation of Saints, which took its birth in the fourth and fifth Age: 'Tis the fourth change which altered Chriſtianity in thoſe Ages: the firſt was the Original of Monkery; the ſecond was the Eſtabliſhment of the Hierarchy; the third was Oecumenical Councils; and the fourth was the Invocation of Saints, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Reliques: Behold a fifth, 'tis the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Images into Churches. The Worſhip and Adoration of Images did not come ſo ſoon, and we
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:49990:246"/>do not ſee the ſpreading thereof, till the ſixth Age: But in the fourth and fifth Ages men began to bring Images into ſome Chappels conſecrated to the Memory of Martyrs. And 'tis a thing that could not fail to happen; One depth calleth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and when men fell into Idolatry to men, they were not far from Idolatry to Images: for 'tis very natural to repreſent thoſe men which we Invoke, and to give Honour to their Images. For which reaſon I am amazed that the ſecond Part of <hi>Paganiſm, viz.</hi> The Adoration of Images came ſo ſlowly after the Worſhip and Adoration of Saints. But the averſation which the firſt Chriſtians had for Idols, held firm as yet for ſome time after the Birth of the Superſtitious Worſhip of the Martyrs, and their Reliques: It is therefore true, that in ſome Provinces, about the end of the fourth Age, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may ſhew you Hiſtorical Repreſentations in the Churches; they began to paint the Hiſtories of the Bible: It appears by a paſſage of <hi>Gregory Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Greg. Niſſ. Orat. de Divin. filii &amp; Sp. S.</note> that the Hiſtory of the Sacrifice of <hi>Abraham</hi> was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by another Homily of the ſame <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Orat. in Theodor. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note>, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they began alſo to paint the Hiſtories of ſome Martyr, or Martyrs in their Temples: <hi>The Painter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>hath expreſſed the Flowers of his Art, drawing on a Table the great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Martyr, his Reſiſtance, his Combates, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and bruitiſh Aſſaults of Tyrants, the flaming Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the happy Conſummation of the Martyr; and a Table in which was Jeſus Christ in Humane ſhape, over-looking the Combate.</hi> If we were of the mind of your Convertors, we would hide ſuch things, as you might very well be ignorant in; but we are ſincere in our Confeſſions, as we are willing to
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:49990:246"/>be in our Defence and Allegations:
<list>
                  <item>1. For firſt we do maintain, That in the fourth Age the Church had as yet a horrour for all Worſhip of Images: They begun to introduce them into Churches on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Ornament. And if your Convertors do produce to you any thing of theſe Ages, which ſeems to ſignifie that they Adored Images, hold it for certain, that they are falſe paſſages, or taken from falſe and ſuppoſitious Books.</item>
                  <item>2. We do maintain, That the uſe of painting Hiſtorical Tables in Churches, did not begin till about the end of the fourth Age: And before <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> of <hi>Capadocia,</hi> who lived about the Year 380, we do not find any mention thereof among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</item>
                  <item>3. In the third place, you ought to know, That this Cuſtom was then very rare, and that we cannot diſcover any Churches, but thoſe of <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia,</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and a certain Church in <hi>Italy,</hi> where Images were ſeen in their Temples.</item>
               </list> 'Tis true ſome quote a paſſage of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> taken from his Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Martyr <hi>Barlaam,</hi> by which they would prove, that in the Chappel of this Martyr, they had ſet the Hiſtory of his Martyrdom: for St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> there invites the Painters to repreſent magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently the Combates of the Martyr. But it is certain, that the Painters to whom he ſpeaks are Orators, which he exhorts to repreſent well in their Diſcourſes, the glorious Sufferings of <hi>Barla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> But although it ſhould be to Painters (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Figure) that <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks, as the City of <hi>Ceſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> whereof he was Biſhop, was in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> this would ſerve to fortifie that which we maintain, <hi>(viz)</hi> That this dangerous Cuſtom of introducing Images into Churches, was not any where elſe, but in the Province of <hi>Cappadocia:</hi> for no Author of this Age ſpeaks of it, but the Biſhops of that Country: unleſs it be <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> who
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:49990:247"/>tells us, That he cauſed the Repreſentation of the Sufferings of St. <hi>Faelix</hi> the Martyr, to be put in the Chappel that was dedicated unto him. Now 'tis to be obſerved, that this <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> fells us alſo two conſiderable things, <hi>First,</hi> That the Cuſtom of placing of Pictures in Churches, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> That that which put him upon doing it, was a deſign to repreſent to the Eyes of the Country People, thoſe Combates, the painting whereof would make more impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, than Deſcriptions made by the mouths of Orators.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some peradventure will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faulinus Bibliothec <hi>Pat. Tom. 14. Edit.</hi> Lugdu.</note> ſays he, <hi>what was the reaſon which occaſioned me to reſolve to make the Figures of Animate Creatures, to be painted in Sacred Houſes, ſeeing the Cuſtom thereof is very rare.</hi> And he adds, <hi>That it was to try whether the ſight of theſe enameld and raiſed Shadows of Colours, would not make ſome impreſſion upon the groſs and ſtupid minds of the Vulgar.</hi> He ſays alſo, in the ſame place, That his end was to employ theſe Dregs of the People in the Contemplation of theſe Figures on Feaſt days, to the end that they might ſpend the leſs time in Debauchery. Obſerve thereon, that then it was very rare to ſee Pictures in Churches, therefore they did not expoſe them to the Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People. For Objects of Adoration and Worſhip ought to be known by all: beſides, they were put there only for the uſe of the Vulgar; 'twas not therefore to give any Worſhip to them: for they are not only Country People which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to Religious Worſhip. To conclude, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> ſays expreſly, That it was only for Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration, and not for Worſhip. 'Tis therefore from this good, but ſuperſtitious man <hi>Paulinus,</hi> that this leud ſaying hath taken its original, <hi>That Images
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:49990:247"/>are the Books of the Ignorant.</hi> 4. The fourth thing to which you ought to give attention is, That then they did not ſet in Churches any Figure, Image, or Statue of a ſingle perſon, but Hiſtorical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations in large Tables, where many perſons and many actions were repreſented. This makes almoſt an infinite difference: for it never entred into the mind of Man, that Hiſtorical Tables, whereon were ſome times repreſented the Devil tempting <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> oftentimes Hang-men pbluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the fleſh of a Martyr, with Pincers, were placed there for Worſhip. For ſo men would Worſhip the Devil, as well as Jeſus Chriſt, and the Hangmen as well as the Martyr. Indeed when the Idolatry of Images was brought into the Church, 'twas by Pictures or Statues which repreſented but one or two of the Saints. Now 'tis certain, ſay I, that about the end of the fourth Age, thoſe which gave themſelves liberty of introducing Images in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Churches, placed nothing there but Hiſtorical Pictures and Tables. To prove the contrary to you, they may produce a paſſage of <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen,</hi> where he complains of this, That ſome would deſtroy the City of <hi>Dioceſarea,</hi> raze the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and pull down the Statues thereof:<note n="*" place="margin">Epiſt. ad. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</note> 
               <hi>Our greateſt grief,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is not that the Statues are pluckt down, although that be troubleſome too.</hi> Becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before he was ſpeaking of the Ruine of Temples, ſome it may be will ſerve themſelves of that, to perſwade you, that Statues were in their Temples. But that is falſe, and 'tis certain that he ſpeaks of Statues which were in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places: <hi>Our grief is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that with the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, they pull down and deſtroy an ancient City.</hi> And to the end that you may not be able to delude your ſelves thereby, be advertiſed, That the <hi>Greeks</hi> would
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:49990:248"/>never ſuffer Statues in their Churches, and that yet to this day they Adore nothing but Images, or plain and flat Pictures; and by a humour ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently pleaſant, they accuſe the <hi>Latines</hi> of being I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolators, becauſe they Adore Statues: As if their Images of <hi>Moſaick</hi> Work, were much more worthy of Adoration, than Emboſſed Figures. However it be, this demonſtrates, that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> could not ſpeak of Statues which were in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To conclude, the laſt thing whereof you are to be advertiſed, about the Original of Images, is, That in the time that this miſcheivous Cuſtom of putting Images in Churches began in ſome places, the good Biſhops oppoſed themſelves thereto with Zeal, and treated it as an Abomination. It were convenient that you ſhould read thereon a paſſage of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salamina</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved about the year 375, that is to ſay, exactly in the ſame time that <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> ſuffered Pictures in the Churches of <hi>Cappadocia, I came one day,</hi> ſays <hi>Epiphanius, into a Village which is called</hi> Anablata, ('twas a Village in <hi>Paleſtine</hi>)<note n="*" place="margin">Epiphan. in Epiſt. ad Joh. Jeruſ.</note> 
               <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen there, as I paſſed by, a burning Lamp, I enquired what place it was; I learnt that it was a Church, and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred there to Pray, I found on the Door of the Church, a died Vail hanging there, having an Image painted on it, as it were of Chriſt, or ſome Saint: for I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in good truth, whoſe Image it was; having therefore ſeen that contrary to the Authority of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they had hung the Image of a Man in the Church, I rent the Vail, and adviſed the Sexton of the place, to employ it rather to wrap up the body of ſome poor dead perſon to carry him to his Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> took it ill, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> had attempted ſuch an Action in a Dioceſs
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:49990:248"/>where he had no Juriſdiction, but he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Action in itſelf.</p>
            <p>This paſſage is without reply, and your Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers will never have any thing to anſwer to it. It appears that the uſe of introducing Images into Churches, was ſo rare, and ſo little received, that he which undertook to put one in the Church of <hi>Anablata,</hi> did not dare to put it any farther then the Door. At this day men have the inſolence to ſet them upon Altars. And even <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while before, in the Church where this Image was, lookt upon the attempt as the Violation of the Law, although it were even the Image of Jeſus Chriſt: for he ſuppoſes it might be the Image of our Lord; nevertheleſs he made not the leaſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to rend it, and hated not the attempt ever the leſs. Notwithſtanding 'tis very probable that after St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> the Cuſtom of ſo placing Pictures and Tables in the Churches of the Martyrs, did continue and increaſe. The People which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall into Superſtition, did not tarry long ere they abuſed thoſe Images, which were placed for them in the Sepulchres of the Martyrs: 'tis from the People that the Worſhip of Images came, as well as the Invocation of Saints; that could not ſtay long after this; for when they adored men, which might be painted, 'tis natural to make I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of them. So St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> learns us, that in his time the Invocation of Saints paſſing from the People to the Paſtors, the People running much father, began to Adore the Pictures of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. But behold how he ſpeaks of it: The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> heaped together all the popular Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all the Actions of private Perſons, to make Crimes of them againſt the Church; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>St. Auſtine</hi> tells them,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de-Moribus Eccl. c. <hi>34.</hi>

            <p>But that in the fourth and fifth Ages men did not give any Religious Worſhip to Images, by the publick Authority and Approbation of the Paſtors, is a truth which cannot be diſputed by thoſe who have any remains of Conſcience and Honour: This appears by the Teſtimonies of Authors of that time: by the Deed of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which we reported touching the Image which he found in <hi>Anablata;</hi> and by another paſſage of the ſame St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> cited by the Council of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> againſt Images, in the Reign of <hi>Conſtantine Copronimus,</hi> and reported by that Image-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>

                  <hi>An Article of Controverſie.</hi> A continuation of the matter of Schiſm; that the great Corruption of the Roman Church, forced us to a Separation.</head>
               <p>HItherunto in ſpeaking of Schiſm, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd upon one or other of theſe two ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; either that our ſeparation was not eſtabliſhed upon good Reaſons, or at leaſt that the corruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was not at the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and therefore it was in ſome ſort tolerable. We have proved in our thirteenth <hi>Paſtoral Letter,</hi> that although our Fathers had done ill in their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, nevertheleſs you do not hazard your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by continuing in the Proteſtant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Afterwards we made it appear, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> very corrupt, although the Corruption were not wholly intollerable, you cannot return thither at this day, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelves, becauſe the Providence of God hath drawn you thence by a Miracle, in the perſons of your Fathers. And we have diſperſed the Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you put upon yourſelves therein, and which ſome amongſt you have communicated to thoſe which are fled for Protection into theſe Countries. But at preſent let us no longer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing which is falſe; let us conſider things as they are, <hi>i. e.</hi> let us conſider the Corruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in its utmoſt extent, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon upon it: It is the third Suppoſition, according to which I will ſhew you, that you cannot with a good Conſcience return to Popery: If the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be extream, if ſhe be Idolatrous, if ſhe be Impure, if ſhe be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:49990:250"/>if ſhe have introduced true <hi>Paganiſm</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, we muſt neceſſarily Separate from her, as ſoon as we can; and the Separation being made, to re-unite ourſelves unto her is a Crime for which we can expect no Mercy. There can be nothing of doubt in this kind of reaſoning, but the Suppoſition, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the Corruption of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is extream, and wholly unſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; So that this is the only thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to do, about the matter of Schiſm, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Separation, and prove to you, that you cannot return to Popery without Damnation; this we ſhall do in this, and the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>To give you a true and natural Idea of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Popery by a ſhort Diſcription, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at firſt, That you diſcharge yourſelves of thoſe vain Charms, and falſe Appearances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal they dreſs, and preſent it to your Eyes. Firſt, you may not conſider Popery by the Chriſtianity upon which 'tis built, for 'tis thither that you turn your Eyes immediately. 'Tis a Religion, ſay you, where the true God is worſhipped, and the true Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, where the Holy Trinity is believed, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God, Redemption by the Death of Chriſt Jeſus, the laſt Judgment, the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, everlaſting Life, and everlaſting Death. How can ſuch a Chriſtianity be ill? Diſtinguiſh my Brethren, in the Popiſh Church Chriſtianity from Popery. That which I would have you conſider, and which I have told you is Chriſtianity. But that which I will deſcribe unto you, the uglineſs whereof I will ſet before you in an abridgement, is quite another thing, 'tis that which hath been added to Chriſtianity, 'tis Popery. Say not it ſufficeth us that Chriſtianity doth continue in the Roman Church, that is falſe, it is not ſufficient. 'Tis not
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:49990:251"/>enough that the Subſtance doth continue in poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wine to make it ſafe, and wholſom. Do not you imagine that this is only a plain Compariſon, 'tis an example that doth demonſtrate, and prove Wine as good, and excellent as it is, is not more ſpoiled by the Mortal Poyſon mingled with it, then Chriſtianity in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpoiled by the Popery added thereto. Have you never read any where that the Roman Church is like a great double Temple, whereof the lower part is conſecrated to God, and the ſuperior part to an Idol? This is a Compariſon which hath all the force of Examples to prove, and demonſtrate. Do you believe, that a man after he had worſhipped in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, conſecrated to the true God, ſhould aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church above, and adore Idols? Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſay I, that ſuch a man were in a good and ſafe way? 'Tis true, Chriſtianity remains in the Roman Religion, 'tis the Church below; but they have built upon it the Idol Church, and that is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Do not you imagine therefore, that you can Worſhip only in the Church below, or live in the Chriſtianity of the Roman Church without parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in Popery. This cannot be, theſe two parts of the Roman Church are not built together as two Churches, whereof the one is below, and the other above. By an unhappy Art of the Devil you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the one without entering into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. You cannot worſhip God without partaking in the Worſhip of Idols. You cannot partake in the Heavenly Sacrament of Jeſus Chriſt without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in a falſe and corrupt Sacrifice; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proſtrating yourſelves before the Idol of Bread. You cannot confeſs Jeſus Chriſt Head of the Church without adhering to a falſe Head, to the Head of a Body which is altogether Antichriſtian. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call upon God in publick Worſhip, unleſs at
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:49990:251"/>the ſame time you call upon Creatures: It remains therefore, that we prove unto you, that Popery, ſo confounded and mixt with Chriſtianity, is mortal, impure, and intollerable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond general Advice which I have to give you is, That well to underſtand Popery, you muſt not look upon it in the Books of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertors, in the Explications of the Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or other painted Tables which diſguiſe to you the Religion into which they force you to enter. Diſcharge yourſelves alſo from this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed imagination, That we ought to attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Popery but what is ordained by its Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. For there is nothing more falſe, and more diſtant from truth, then that the Councils have not expreſſed in their Deciſions, all thoſe frightful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes into which Popery is fallen, therefore they are not to be imputed to her. 'Tis a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, all that is done in a Church, be it by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her Councils, be it by uſe and common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, ought to be imputed to her. 'Tis true, that St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in a paſſage which we quoted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, would not grant, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> ſhould impute certain Superſtitions which the People pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, to the Church: but 'twas becauſe there were few perſons, in compariſon to others, that fell into them: And the Teachers condemned them, inſtead of ſupporting and maintaining them. But we impute nothing to Popery, but Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances univerſally practiſed, and defended by their moſt famous Doctors. I will give you yet a third Advice, 'Tis that for the true underſtanding of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and all its Deformities, you muſt not look on it in certain places, and at certain times. For Example: At this day in <hi>France,</hi> they ſhew you the Popiſh Religion in a ſmooth and poliſhed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, with reſpect to the Authority of the Pope:
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:49990:252"/>they tell you, that to ſpeak properly, he is no more than the <hi>firſt Biſhop,</hi> he is not the Vicar of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> that he is not the true Head of the Church, nor the true Center of Unity, that he is not Infallible, that he has no more Power over the Biſhops, than the Biſhops have over him: they ſpeak to you with great indifference concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Worſhip of Images, as a thing eſteemed not very neceſſary; they do extreamly mollifie the Invocation of Saints, reducing it to a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Biſhops give order, that little of thoſe popular Devotions which are capable of giving you ſcandal, be practiſed in their Dioceſſes. I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to you, that it is not by the ſmall Country of <hi>France,</hi> nor by this little ſpace of preſent time, that you ought to look on Popery, to know and ſee all its Deformities. In what follows, we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew you, that all theſe Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are nothing, that they are fictitious; and that although they ſhould go further than I know not what appearances, it would not ſuffice; but in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of that, I adviſe you at preſent, my Brethren, that for a true underſtanding of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, it behoves you to look on it every-where, and in all times: You muſt behold it in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> as we as in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> you muſt look on it in all preceeding Ages, at leaſt in the ſeven hundred or eight hundred Years which went before our Reformation; obſerving theſe three Rules,
<list>
                     <item>1. That you look on Popery ſuch as it is in itſelf, diſtinct from Chriſtianity.</item>
                     <item>2. That you look on it in its practice, and univerſal uſage.</item>
                     <item>3. To conclude, that you look on it above all in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as elſewhere;</item>
                  </list> and that you look on it in all thoſe times which preceeded the Reformation. If you do thus, ſay I, I do maintain that you cannot behold the Deformitie of Popery without horrour.</p>

I do profeſs, that he muſt be

Judge whether the true Church, and the true Religion, could permit and ſuffer ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Diſorders! Are theſe the Paſtors of Jeſus Chriſt, or the falſe Paſtors of him, who in the laſt times was to teach a Doctrine of Devils, by men whoſe Conſciences were ſeared with a hot Iron, forbidding to Marry, and abſtaining from Meats, which God hath created to be received by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

                     <p>I don't doubt but you are informed of what paſſes in <hi>France,</hi> with reſpect to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which groan under the Yoak of cruel Perſecution; but it may be you are not yet informed of a new kind of Perſecution which they have lately invented: After they had tired out the Conſtancy of an infinite number of unhappy perſons; for ſeeing that they had made no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſs in the Work of Converſion, they ſend them
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:49990:256"/>to the Iſlands of <hi>America,</hi> in the King's ships, to be ſold to them who give moſt for them. Theſe things are an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of Nature, that thoſe who are called Chriſtians ſhould ſell other Chriſtians for Money; 'tis a thing that was never heard of, till this miſerable Age in which we live. The Tears which I have, and do pour out every moment, permits me not to tell you all that I have ſeen, being accompanied by Monſieur —, your Son, and an Officer, which eſcaped, and is now in our Veſſel; a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Wind hath cauſed us to put in, and refreſh our ſelves in the Haven of <hi>Almaria,</hi> which is in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Granada,</hi> and hath kept us there five Weeks, and every day we ſee Veſſels arrive there from ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other, which this tempeſtuous ſeaſon doth oblige to ſeek ſome place of ſafety. On the ſixth of <hi>April,</hi> a Veſſel, bearing the Admiral's Flag of <hi>France,</hi> arrived there: As ſoon as the ſtormy ſeaſon was over, Monſieur the Count of <hi>Stirum,</hi> ſent one of his Lieutenants to the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, to inform himſelf whence it came, and whither it went; we learnt that it came from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> and that it went to carry them for Slaves to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> This obliged me to deſire a Challoupe, that I might ſatisfie myſelf in the doubt wherein I was, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting there might be in it men of our Religion; and indeed it proved two true. After we had been on Board the <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, they brought us a Collation, and ſoon after we ſaw ſome Gentlewomen appear, upon whoſe Countenances Death was drawn, who came upon the Deck to take the Air: We asked them upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they went to <hi>America;</hi> they anſwered us, with an Heroick Conſtancy, <hi>Becauſe they would not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt, nor Proſtrate ourſelves before I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: Behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>our Crime.</hi> We enquired of them, if there were any from <hi>Cevennes;</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, there was two from thence, the one of fifteen, the other of ſixteen years of Age, who were below, and they were of a Village called St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> This increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:49990:256"/>my Curioſity to ſee them, the one was ſick unto Death, the other was with her to aſſiſt her in what ſhe could: At my deſire the Captain granted, that ſhe who was not ſick, ſhould come up; as ſoon as ſhe appeared on the Deck, I well perceived that her countenance was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me: Monſieur your Son askt her, <hi>Made-moiſelle,</hi> from whence are you? She ſaid, I am from St. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> What is your Name? I am named <hi>Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique.</hi> I needed no more to aſſure me, that they were my Coſin Germaines: I had reſolved to permit her to ſpeak a while, but the tears which began to run from my eyes would not ſuffer it: I drew near to her and ſaid, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, do you not know me? At that very moment, caſting her eye upon me, falling on my neck, ſhe ſaid, Is it poſſible, my dear Coſin, that I ſhould ſee you once again in my Misfortunes. She added a hundred other things ſo affecting, that there was not a perſon in the Ship, which did not pour out a river of tears, at leaſt of thoſe who had the guard and keeping of them. I deſired leave of the Captain to ſee her Siſter, which was not able to come upon the Deck, which he freely gra<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

They told me, the moſt moving things in the World, and inſtead of giving them Conſolation, they comforted me; and I not being able to ſpeak, they told me, with one common voice, We put our hands upon our mouths, and ſay that all things come from Him who is King of Kings, and in Him we put our truſt. On the other fide, we ſaw a hundred poor miſerable perſons, oppreſſed with old Age, whom the torments of Tyrants had reduced to their laſt gaſp: We ſaw there of all ſorts, of all ages, and of all qualities, for they ſpare none. They told me, when they left <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> they were two hundred and fifty perſons, Men, Women, Girls and Boys; and that in fifteen days, eighteen of them died. There is but one Gentlewoman
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49990:257"/>that is of <hi>Poictou,</hi> all the reſt are of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> or <hi>Mom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier,</hi> and the Countries in the Neighbourhood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A Country-man who lived about a League and half from St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who had ſuffered all that he could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, upon whom theſe Barbarians could gain nothing, was put on board among others, and is ſince dead in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of <hi>Granada;</hi> his Son, who was in the ſame Ship, knew me at firſt ſight; he is called <hi>Griollet,</hi> and the Village of his abode <hi>Ceurla.</hi> There are yet ſix Veſſels upon their departure from <hi>Provence,</hi> laden with theſe poor Men, who expect nothing but a fair Wind to hoiſt ſail. I was willing to have encouraged my Kinſewoman, ſhe told me, Dear Coſin, 'tis not Death that I fear, if God will call me hence, I ſhall eſcape a great many Miſeries which I have yet to ſuffer, but I am reſigned to whatever he ſhall pleaſe to lay upon me. A young Gentleman which the Captain entertained at his own Table, died of Grief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome eight days ſince. After I was returned to our Veſſel, and had given a particular account of what I had ſeen, Monſieur the Count of <hi>Stirom</hi> ſignified a great deal of trouble at it, and ſent me back again with ſome Fowls, Wine, and other things, together with ſome Money for their refreſhment; and if it had been in his power to have reſcued them from their Miſery, I am ſure as he would have ſpared nothing to have done it. Mademoiſelle, your Siſter, is yet wandring about, as my Kinſewomen informed me; they themſelves lay hid a long while in the Woods of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Mother of a Miniſter, and her Siſter, who are alſo in the ſame Ship, intreated me to give intelligence concerning them to her Son, who is a Miniſter in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he is called Monſieur <hi>Arnolt,</hi> of <hi>Languedock.</hi> Monſieur, your Son would have written to you, but we have thought that this will ſuffice for us all.</p>

            <p>IN the preceding Letters we have Examined the divers Alteration which have happend in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the fourth and fifth Ages, and we have there found five very conſiderable ones:

            <p n="1">1. The remained in the Opinions in which the Church was, with reſpect to the Sacrifice, which at this day is called the Sacrifice of the Maſs: The Hereſie of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> about it, is one of the moſt novel, and alſo of thoſe which have had the longeſt time to digeſt and compleat itſelf; it received not its higheſt perfection till the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> In the fourth and fifth Ages, men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſpeak of the Sacrament as of a Sacrifice; the exteriour form of Sacrifice did augment by the addition of ſome Ceremonies, and becauſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy did always enlarge itſelf by ſome new Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Nevertheleſs, at the bottom they underſtood that it was no new Sacrifice, but improperly ſo called, a Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, a Sacrifice of Commemoration, the Image of a Sacrifice, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as the other parts of the Worſhip of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion are Sacrifices.

                  <hi>An Article of Controverſie.</hi> A Concluſion of the Matter of Schiſm; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Corruption of Popery hath forced us to a Separation.</head>
               <p>IN the preceding Letter, we began to make for you a Picture of <hi>Popery,</hi> to convince you of the Juſtice and Neceſſity of our Reformation. This Corruption of <hi>Popery</hi> may be either conſidered in its Guides, its Head, and principal Members, or in its Doctrine: We did conſider this Corruption in its Head, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Pope;</hi> in its Guides, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Primates, Archbiſhops, and Biſhops: in its principal Members, ſuch are the Prieſts, the Monks, and the Nuns; and in all this, we have ſeen the Characters of the Conductors of <hi>Babel,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Mouths of <hi>Popery,</hi> but what can proceed out of ſuch Mouths? 'Tis eaſie to judge: They appoint for you at this day, Preachers which ſpeak good things. There have been for ſome time paſt, a number of perſons raiſed up to obtain the uſe of the Word of God, and the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for the people: But this is neither ancient nor general, you muſt know the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Miniſtery by what it was not long ſince, and by what it is in all places where 'tis regnant: hear thoſe which tell you the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is a dangerous Book, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Book, all full of <hi>Traps, Snares,</hi> and <hi>Precipieces;</hi> that an infinite number of men have ruined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby; that 'tis from thence that Hereticks have drawn their Hereſies; that 'tis imperfect; that it contains not half the Chriſtian Religion; that to underſtand the true ſence of this half, there
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49990:261"/>needs another which is called the <hi>Unwritten Word,</hi> Tradition, the infallible Voice of the Church. And a man knows not where to find this Voice. However it be, they do aſſure you, that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> has no Authority without Tradition; that without the Teſtimony of the Church, we were no more obliged to believe the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or the Fables of <hi>Homer.</hi> Moreover, at this day the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> great Defenders of the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> tell you plainly, and without ſcruple or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, That by the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> we cannot prove the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt; and that it were a Folly more clear than the day, to go about to prove the Divinity of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> by the <hi>Scripture</hi> itſelf. There is nothing that <hi>Popery</hi> doth not do to decry this ſacred Book: Not only 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, obſcure, it has no authority by itſelf, but it is maimed, imperfect, many Books thereof are loſt, thoſe which remain are corrupt, either by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or by the negligence of Tranſcribers; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know with any certainty what is intire, or what is not; the Tranſlations thereof are ſpoiled, there are none of them conformable to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. Good God, what a <hi>Prodigy</hi> is this! And how great muſt the patience of God be, to tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a Religion which makes it its buſineſs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate, to vilifie, and abaſe thoſe Oracles which ought to be ſo venerable among all Chriſtians? What Chriſtianity is this, but that, in which for the ſpace of more than a thouſand years, the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> was an unknown Book almoſt to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and is ſo yet at this day in all thoſe places where <hi>Popery</hi> domineers without contradiction? Obſerve alſo the profound Ignorance in which thoſe people live, that are ſubject to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Inquiſition. To find among them the Figures of <hi>Aretine,</hi> or ſome other infamous Work, is no fault;
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49990:261"/>but to find there a Bible, in the Vulgar Language, is a crime not to be forgiven: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in theſe Countries, they know GOD no better, and it may be a great deal worſe, than in <hi>Turky.</hi> The ſacred Hiſtories are utterly unknown to them; they know nothing of Chriſtianity, but what we find thereof in their <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> mingled and confounded with the Errours and Superſtitions of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inſtead of the true Goſpel, what do they preach in thoſe places that are under the Dominion of <hi>Popery?</hi> And what have they preacht in the times when it did Rule, and prevail without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction? They did there preach, 1. Corrupt Morality, according to which a man might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Murder, to ſave a Crown, to defend his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſecure himſelf from ſome ſmall Affront; according to which a man might Rob, when a perſon did not think himſelf ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed for his labours; according to which a man might exerciſe Uſury, and infamous Monopolies; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which a man might keep Concubines, and abandon himſelf to <hi>Sodomy,</hi> without mortal Sin; according to which a man might Lye by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation, and mental Reſervations; according to which he might live all his life without the Fear of God, without performing one act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or the Love of God to his death; and he might be Diſpenſed with, that at the point of death, provided he exerciſed an act of the fear of Hell, when he receives the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. <hi>Popery</hi> hath produced this deteſtable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; it hath taught it where it could, inſpired it into private perſons, and ſuffered it where it durſt not teach it. For Holy Hiſtory, inſtead of the pious and ſacred Hiſtories of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which might turn mens minds towards Devotion,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:49990:262"/>they entertain the people with Fabulous Legends: Inſtead of ſpeaking to them of the Miracles and Greatneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, they ſpeak of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Virgin; they ſay that ſhe was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſin; that her Father and her Mother had been advertiſed of her Birth by an Angel; that at her Birth the Angels aſſembled together, and formed a Quire and Conſort in the Air; that this Celebration of the Birth of the Holy Virgin, is repeated every year on the ſame day; that many Saints have heard them in the Air; that this Holy Virgin was bred and brought up in the Temple, and in the moſt holy Place called the <hi>Sanctuary;</hi> that when ſhe conceived Jeſus Chriſt, it was by three drops of her Bloud, which the holy Spirit took from her heart; that after ſhe had lived moſt holily, ſhe died in the preſence of all the Apoſtles, whom the Holy Spirit brought in the Air from all parts of the World, whither they were gone to preach the Goſpel; that three days after ſhe roſe again, and was carried up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with charming Muſick made by the Voices of Jeſus Chriſt and the Angels; and that ſhe was ſet very near to Jeſus Chriſt, above all the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims.</hi> After the Aſſumption of the Virgin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, they made her do a thouſand and a thouſand ridiculous Miracles upon Earth: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe appeared to a Monk, ſometimes to a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, ſometimes to ſome one of her devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: ſhe kiſſes them, ſhe makes them kiſs her; ſhe opens her boſom to them; ſhe gives them ſuck from her breaſts; ſhe appoints them to build a Chappel to her in ſuch a place, and that they ſhould perform ſuch or ſuch Devotions to her; ſhe fixes herſelf in certain places, and there makes her choice to dwell, and do Miracles: All thoſe which come thither for Sickneſs, Blindneſs, Palſie,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49990:262"/>loſs of Bloud, Deafneſs, loſs of Members, return thence ſafe and ſound: when one of her Houſes formerly frequented, ceaſed to be ſo, ſhe tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it beyond the Seas, and fixed it in another Country to draw thither new Servants to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; ſhe forgets nothing that may favour thoſe which ſerve her: In one Convent ſhe takes the place, office, and figure of a debauched Nun, which ran to the places of Proſtitution, becauſe this Nun, when ſhe was going, did devoutly commit the Convent into her hand; In another place, becauſe an Abbeſs did moſt devoutly commend herſelf to her, when ſhe had polluted herſelf with her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, ſhe delivered her in private of her great Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and reſtored her Virginity, in ſuch ſort, that thoſe who had accuſed her, remained aſhamed and confounded.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of entertaining the people with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Vertues of true Saints, as were the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, to oblige them to an imitation of them, <hi>Popery</hi> hath ſubſtituted unto them new Saints, which were Fools, and wicked Fools too, <hi>St. Francis, St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick, St. Hyacinth, St. Vincent Ferrerius;</hi> or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Saints, as <hi>St. Chriſtopher,</hi> and the eleven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Virgins, or modern and unknown Saints, ſuch as <hi>St. Milorus, St. Alldem, St. Colganus,</hi> and a thouſand others: To which they attribute ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and impertinent actions for Vertues, and ſuch ſottiſhneſſes for Miracles, as are unworthy of thoſe little Demons called <hi>Hobgoblins.</hi> One to teſtifie his Humility, made himſelf to be toſſed in a Sieve by little Children; another, to draw upon himſelf contempt, counterfeited the Fool and the Ideot; another fouled the Bed of his Hoſt, that he might be deſpiſed of him; another kept company with Beaſts, Wolves, and Swallows; another preached to Fiſhes, or Birds; another ſtripped himſelf naked,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49990:263"/>and in that condition expoſed himſelf to publick view; another made himſelf Women of Snow, and embraced them to cool and extinguiſh his Luſt; another, through great Mortification, lay with the faireſt Women without touching them; another made himſelf a Bed of Stones, and Sticks, and crowns of Nails, and Girdles of Iron; another thruſt Thorns into his Body, waſhed his hands in quick Lime, and covered his face with an eating Powder, which made the fleſh thereof one intire Ulcer. Behold a ſmall part of the Idea that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> gives us of the Vertue of its Saints. As to Miracles, they produce to the people faithful Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, as they ſay, by which it appears, that ſome of theſe Saints, for their parts, have raiſed fifty two dead perſons; another thirty; another twelve; another ſix, three, or four: They have healed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Diſeaſes, raiſed Dogs, Parrots, and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals from the dead. The Water in which they waſhed their hands cured all ſorts of Diſeaſes; the clippings of their Hair, and the parings of their Nails, put into the craks of Walls, cloſed them up again, and have made Houſes ready to fall, firm and ſtrong. When theſe Saints preached to the Birds, theſe Animals reached out their bills, and clapt their wings; when they preached to the Fiſhes, they gathered together on the top of the Water, that they might hear; when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they drove away not only evil Spirits which troubled them, but alſo living Creatures which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted their Diſcourſe: They made Angles ſerve them not only at Maſs, but alſo they uſed them as Grooms to dreſs their Horſes: They cauſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be carried by the Devil to places whither they would go; they made him hold the Candle till he burnt his fingers therewith: if the Devil turned himſelf into a Cat, they put him into ſuch
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:49990:263"/>diſtreſs, that he left behind him a matter which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Air: When Birds were roaſted, and ſet upon the Table, with ſigns of the Croſs they made them fly away: Another nouriſhed a Child in a Deſart, by making him ſuck the clapper of a little Bell: another hung his clothes upon the ſhaddow of a Tree, or on a ray of the Sun, as upon a Peg: another made whole again a Basket of Eggs that had been broken: another made a golden Cup of a pound of Butter: another by ſucking a leprous perſon, drew from his Navel three great lunchions of fat matter, whereof he made ſo many Ingots of Gold: To conclude, there are no Impe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tinencies, nor ridiculous things which <hi>Popery</hi> doth not make its Saints to do; and behold the Hiſtory which they put in the place of the Evangelical Story.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns Doctrine, they ſpeak but little of the Auguſt Miſteries of Religion to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuch as are thoſe of the Divine Attributes, the Perſons of the Trinity, the Incarnation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt Jeſus. Theſe Miſteries were laid by and neglected, or if they ſpake any thing of them, 'twas after a Scholaſtical manner, and method, 'twas by mingling with it a barbarous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of <hi>entities</hi> and <hi>quiddities,</hi> with obſcure and unintelligible diſtinctions; 'twas by raiſing fooliſh queſtions on the ſubject of the moſt venerable Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: For example, Whether God could make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without form; whether he could command ſin; whether this propoſition, God is a Beetle, or a Gourd, could be as true as this, <hi>God is a Man;</hi> whether the number of three Perſons in God, ought to be referred to the firſt, or ſecond intentions; whether the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, could take the nature of a Devil, or of an Aſs, as he took the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man? The Books which contain theſe fine queſtions, are not yet deſtroyed.</p>

At leaſt they entertain people with the falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Popery. Inſtead of ſpeaking to them of the efficacy of the venerable Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, they ſpeak nothing to them, but of the greatneſs and utilities of the Holy Sacrifice of the Altar called the Maſs. It was good for every thing, for the ſound, and for the ſick, to cure all diſeaſes for Travellers, for thoſe who undertook great things, to find Silver, Horſes, Aſſes, and Hogs that were loſt. 'Twas good for the Dead, as well as for the Living, 'twas excellent to fetch Souls from Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or to abate their Sufferings, for which reaſon they could not tell how to ſay too many for that purpoſe, 100. 200. 300. 1000. 2000. 3000. 4000. and all with deſign to draw by this practice Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for a million of Sluggards, who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live upon but theſe Maſſes. Inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the divine Vertue of the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, they ſpoke nothing but of Purgatory, of a certain Fire which was to burn Souls after Death; but of what ſort of Men? of thoſe who had not made pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Foundations, who had not left great Revenues to Convents, and who had not left great Alms to the Monks to ſay Maſſes. And upon this account they had always ſome Soul in pickle which came from Purgatory bringing News from thence, who deſired Maſſes, and Suffrages, and who complained lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably that his Friends had forſaken him. Amongſt the means of appeaſing the wrath of God, true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which conſiſts in contrition, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, was paſſed over very lightly. But they inſiſted mightily upon Satisfactions, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Whippings, hair Cloaths, and Pilgrimages; they advanced the value of theſe things they ſpake of them with prodigious Exceſſes, and aſcribed Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wholly to them. And becauſe all the World were deſirous to be ſaved, but few were capable of
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:49990:264"/>theſe hard penances, they found out ways more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and commodious. If you give money to a Monk, he will whip himſelf for you, and you ſhall go to Heaven for him. If you give great Alms to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the Frior Minors, or the Preachers, or the Auguſtines, or the Carmelites; if you take the Cord-girdle, or the Roſary of the Fraternity, and beſtow great bounty and liberality on them, and get the Letters of Adoption of <hi>St. Francis,</hi> or <hi>St. Dominick,</hi> by theſe means you partake in the merit, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all the ſcourgings and macerations of the Monks of that Order ſcattered all the World over. For greater ſecurity they have eſtabliſhed a lovely, good, and inexhauſtible Treaſure of Indulgencies, made up of all the ſuperabundant ſcourgings of the good Monks, mingled with the infinite merit of the paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. And from this Treaſure the Biſhops, and the Popes as Soveraign Diſpenſers fetch Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, and Remiſſion for all Sins, for 40000 years, for a 100000 years, for 500000 years, and all this by paying well for it. So that if a man had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſo many enormous Crimes, that they could not be expiated under leſs than 500000 years pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he becomes diſcharged of them in a moment by his Money. And there was no diſtinction of Sins, Inceſts, Adulteries, Paricides, Sodomies, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talities, all fell under the grace of Indulgencies.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of abaſing man before God, by ſpeaking nothing to him but of Grace, and the forgiveneſs of sins; inſtead of ſaying to him perpetually you are ſaved by Grace, through Faith which is the Gift of God; inſtead of making him underſtand that his good Works could merit nothing before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were very imperfect; inſtead, ſay I, of doing all this, they endeavoured to fill man with himſelf; they ſpake nothing to him but of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Works, and of the profitableneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:49990:265"/>ſatisfactions. They made him believe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all in matter of ſatisfactions he could do more than he was obliged unto, that he had merit remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that he did works of ſupererogation, and there are found even in this age devout perſons ſo fooliſh, and proud, as to ſay to their Friends, <hi>that they will give them their Merits.</hi> They never ſpeak any thing to them but of their power, of their free will, of their good works, of their merits, of the crowns which are prepared for them above others. And above all theſe works to which they affix theſe Crowns, are not prayers, devotions, ſevere Morals, or holy lives, Charity, and alms to the poor. But they are ſack-cloaths, and hare-cloaths, 'tis to ſhut themſelves up in Covents, and there make vow of Virginity, 'tis to abſtain from certain Meats, 'tis to live in Retirement without ſeeing or ſpeaking to any one, 'tis to wear a Frock without a Shift. With this Furniture of good Works theſe men look on Heaven as an Inheritance, by full Right, and according to all the Laws and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Juſtice. And for other men, theſe pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed righteous perſons full of phariſaical pride lookt on them with a great contempt, by ſaying, <hi>Come not near me, for I am Holy.</hi>

               <p>Inſtead of inſtructing men in the true way of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, and uniting ourſelves to Chriſt Jeſus, they have invented a carnal and corporeal manner, and of ſmall expence to receive him, and taſt all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fruits of his preſence. They have encloſed him under a morſel of Bread, from whence they have withdrawn the ſubſtance, leaving nothing but the accidents there. And under theſe accidents they have conveyed in the ſubſtance of Jeſus Chriſt, by the vertue of Tranſubſtantiation Concomitancy, and I know not how many monſtrous Imaginations, and barbarous Expreſſions. Behold thus much for the Opinions and Doctrine of Popery.</p>

Let us a little conſider its Worſhip inſtead of the Adoration, and Worſhip of the only true God, who is jealous of his Honour, and Glory, they have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-eſtabliſhed pure Paganiſm. The moſt bleſſed Mother of Jeſus Chriſt hath taken the place of the Mother of the Gods, they have ſet her upon the Throne of God, they call her the Mother of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Redemptrix of Mankind, the perfection and accompliſhment of the Trinity, the Queen of Heaven. They give her the power to command her Son by the Authority of a Mother, they addreſs to her in all their needs, they deſire of her remiſſion of Sins, Health, the life of Men, the recovery of the Sick, and the reſurrection of the Dead. Thoſe which are devoted to her, are much advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others. Devotion to the Bleſſed Virgin is an infallible Mark of Predeſtination. He can't be damned that prays to the Bleſſed Virgin. She hath oftentimes fetched men from Hell, ſhe hath raiſed them to the end that they might do pennance, ſhe hath reſcued the Souls of wicked men out of the hands of Devils, who had already dragg'd them down into the bottomleſs Pit. Perſons rejected by the Son have been received into favour by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the white Ladder of the Virgins Milk, is a more ſure way to aſcend to Heaven, then the red Ladder of the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt. In the place of the Gods, and Demy Gods of Paganiſm, of their Tutelor Gods, their Houſhould Gods, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting Gods, ſubordinate to the great God Jupiter, Popery hath put its Saints, taken not only from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Apoſtles, Martyrs and Confeſſors, but from among its Bygots, its devout People, its Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, its Monks, its Founders of Orders, its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, and proud Phariſees. It hath placed them in Heaven very near unto God. It hath pulled Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt from the Right Hand of the Father, where

Theſe Patron Gods have here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Temples, their Chappels, and their Altars which bear their Names. For here are to be ſeen the Churches, and the Altars of <hi>St. Paul, St. Peter,</hi> the Virgin, and other Saints. They have their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Maſs, that is to ſay, the adorable Body of the Saviour of the World, and God of the Univerſe, by a Worſhip as fantaſtical as it is criminal, is offered to the honour of <hi>St. Peter, St. Paul, St. Roch,</hi> and <hi>St. Francis:</hi> Littanies, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Supplications, Genuflections, and generally all Religious Worſhip is given to theſe inferiour Gods, to theſe canoniz'd Saints: they have their part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where, they are taken for Protectors, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Cities, Families, and perſons, are put under their Defence: Men beg of them Life, Health, Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Eternal Happineſs: They are conſtituted Princes, Regents, Governours of the World, to break the Nations with Rods of Iron: 'Tis not enough to adore their perſons, men adore their Reliques; they expoſe their Aſhes, their Bones, ſhreds of their Cloaths, their Girdles, their Slippers, their Shifts, the Iron, Nails, the Wood, the Bloud, the Tears of Jeſus Chriſt; the Teeth, the Milk, the Hair of the Virgin; the Cradle of Chriſt, and a thouſand other things which are a ſhame to the Chriſtian Name. Theſe Reliques do wonders, heal the ſick, open mens eyes, raiſe the dead. They are laid with great reſpect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon Altars; men bow down to them, and kiſs them with great devotion: they are carried in ſtate about the ſtreets; men cry before them, as
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:49990:266"/>before <hi>Joſeph, Bow the Knee;</hi> men expect from them rain and fair weather, plenty and abundance, peace and war. That <hi>Paganiſm</hi> may be compleat, they have filled the Churches with Idols, which they call holy Images: They picture God againſt his expreſs command; they repreſent Angles, tho' altogether ſpiritual, by corporeal Figures; they ſet up material Croſſes, and Crucifixes of wood, ſtone and metal in all places. The Virgin hath her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, where ſhe is painted with a Child in her arms. All the Saints have their ſeat in their Churches, and upon their Altars; men fall down before them, they offer Incenſe to them, they kiſs them, and act towards them, as if they thought ſome divine Vertue in them. For although the Doctors do ſometimes ſay, that we ought not to affix any divine Vertue to them; they do never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs authorize, by their tolleration and examples, the fury of the People, who make their Nine-days Devotions, and Pilgrimages to them; who there rub their Beads and their Handkercheifs, who make their Children touch them to ſanctifie them thereby. They dreſs them up after a ſtately man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on their Feſtivals, they crown them with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Garlands, they carry them in pomp, and cauſe them to go in proceſſion, they put their confidence in theſe Reliques and theſe Images. The devout perſons bear about them a little pieco of the pretended wood of the Croſs; ſome ſmall filings of the Nails thereof; a pretended Thorn of his Crown; and a little bit of the Bone of a Saint. They carry, ſay I, theſe about them as Preſervatives againſt the Devil, againſt death, and all perils by Sea and Land: Every Family has his Patron, every particular perſon his Saint, for whom he hath a ſingular devotion; he hath the Image thereof placed in his Oratory, he proſtrates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:49990:267"/>before it, to make his Prayers. To indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the true God for all the loſſes which he hath ſuſtained in thoſe Worſhips given to his Creatures, they have dedicated to him in particular, an Idol which they call the <hi>Sacrament of the Altar;</hi> there they adore, in his honour, a little morſel of dry and flat Paſte, which they call in great reverence <hi>Our Lord;</hi> which they make all the World adore with great ceremony, which they carry in ſtate about the ſtreets, that every one may worſhip it, and whoever does not ſo, is execrable and accurſed: they incloſe Jeſus Chriſt therein in a ſtate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, without head, feet, hands, ſoul, motion, or life, ſubject to be eaten by Rats, ſtolen by Thieves, trod under foot by the Prophane, and vomited by the Sick. But in compenſation to God, they adore this Tomb of Jeſus Chriſt, as the ſoveraign God, Creator of Earth and Heaven. If on the one hand they have corrupted the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by adding in the Euchariſt, that which is not there, on the other hand they have taken away half thereof: they give but one part of the Sacrament, and by ſo doing give nothing. They have made private Maſſes, contrary to the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and the cuſtom of all ſound Antiquity. To conclude, What have they not done, to disfigure the Worſhip of God? How many vain and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Ceremonies, and of no uſe? How many ſigns of the Croſs, holy Waters, Exorciſms, <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> and other Toys And above all, they cover this with the Vail of an unknown Tongue; they ſpeak <hi>Latine</hi> to the Peaſants of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who are edified by what is ſaid, as much as if they ſpake <hi>Arabick.</hi> Behold, my Brethren, a very ſhort, but very true <hi>Picture of Popery.</hi> After this, will you think that our Separation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt? You will yet ſay, that we muſt bear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:49990:267"/>things; and that 'tis a Religion in which a man may conveniently enough be ſaved. In the Name of God do not ſay that this <hi>Picture</hi> is extravagant, and that you do not ſee all this therein. For 'tis a true <hi>Deſcription of Popery,</hi> ſuch as it hath been in <hi>France,</hi> as well as elſewhere, for more than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight hundred years. There is no man that knows any thing of Antiquity, that can diſſent from it; 'tis yet at this day the <hi>Popery</hi> of <hi>Italy, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and all Countries where the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not been tollerated. Yet at this day, do the people of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> know any thing of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, but the Names? The Object of their Devotion, is an Image, which works Miracles on the top of a Mountain, or in ſome Church of a Monaſtery; and their Piety ſpends itſelf in Fooliſh and <hi>Pagan</hi> Proceſſions, in which there are mingled all thoſe things which may render a Show ridiculous, and Devotion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. We wiſh you could hear thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſhed from this Country, a while ſince by the order of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> are again returned hither. The <hi>Bible</hi> is impriſoned in thoſe unhappy Countries: An illuſtrious Fugitive carried one of them thither, the Inquiſition, who laid hands on him, ſeized it, and kept it as you keep a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemy: and never could that illuſtrious Exile get it out of their hands, till he came out of the Country, then they permitted this dangerous Book to carry its poyſon elſewhere. God grant that you may give attention to all this, to the end that you may remain fully perſwaded, that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were obliged to ſeparate from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that you cannot return thither without Damnation.</p>

WE ſhall now give you that which we omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our laſt <hi>Letter,</hi> 'tis the Hiſtory of ſome Cruelties exerciſed at <hi>Valence</hi> by <hi>Rapine,</hi> which deſerve to be conſecrated to the memory of all Ages of the Church. Firſt you ſhall know how he treated the Daughters of that illuſtrious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Monſieur <hi>d'Croſs,</hi> and thereby at the ſame time you will learn after what manner he labours in the Converſion of all others: When theſe Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were arrived, and delivered into his hands, he ſeparated them, and put them in differing Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons filled with Dirt and Ordure; he took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Cloaths and Linnen, and ſent them to an Hoſpital to enquire for Shifts, which had been many Weeks, and ſometimes many Months upon Bodies covered with the Itch, Ulcers, and Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, full of matter and putrefaction: after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he cloathed the Daughters of Monſieur <hi>d'Croſs.</hi> This Villain gives them nothing to ſupport their Lives, but a little Water and Bread which Doggs would not eat. <hi>Rapine</hi> viſits them many times in the day, with his Lacques, by whom he ſtrips them, and gives them many blows with a Bull's Piſle, and he himſelf beats them with his Cane on the body, and upon the very face itſelf, in ſuch a manner, that they have nothing of humane ſhape remaining; he breaks them with ſo many blows, that they are not able to ſet one foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore another, nor lift their hand to their mouth, nor move their arms; beſides this, he cauſes them to be plunged many times in a day in a deep Mire, moiſtened with ſtinking water; he draws
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:49990:268"/>them not from thence, till they have loſt all ſenſe and knowledge; at laſt they faint under theſe Torments, which have no example in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the moſt barbarous <hi>Pagans;</hi> after which they were exported to a Convent, where they are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither form nor figure, covered with wounds from head to foot. This we have received from an honeſt Man who ſaw them in this frightful ſtate. Mademoiſelle <hi>d'Farelle</hi> of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> is at this day in the hands of this Villain, with many other Gentlewomen. The <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Greenoble,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while ſince, ſent him twenty five, or twenty ſix perſons, both men and women, to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe ways and methods. Monſieur the Baron <hi>d'Faugere</hi> of <hi>Languedock,</hi> whoſe Fidelity is known to all thoſe who know his perſon, met the Rector of the Jeſuites of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> at <hi>S. Eſprit,</hi> who told him, he was going to <hi>Valence</hi> to labour in the Converſion of an obſtinate <hi>Hugenot,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted all the means that they had made uſe of. And a few days after, meeting the ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, told him, That he could prevail nothing; and that he had ſaid to <hi>Rapine,</hi> that no body but he could be ſucceſsful therein, and that he ought to labour in it. So that this poor Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with many others, have without doubt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ingenious Cruelties of this famous Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>We may very well boaſt, that he has given us an example of Courage and Conſtancy, which may diſpute it with all the ancient and modern Martyrs: 'Tis the famous Monſieur <hi>Menurett,</hi> an Advocate of <hi>Montlimar,</hi> he was eminent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Converſation, for an exemplary Life and Devotion: when the Miſſionary Dragoons were ſent into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and to <hi>Montlimar,</hi> he ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all perſons about him, by his Exhortation and
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:49990:269"/>Example. The Governour of <hi>Montlimar</hi> cauſed him to be arreſted, they put him three Months in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſomething like a Chamber, where he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to lye on but a ſorry Matt. After theſe three Months, they put him into a hideous Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. He went thither full of joy, comforting his Friends who wept, and bewailed him as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him thither: He told them, they ought to rejoyce, that God did him the favour to ſuffer for his Name. He was ſix months in this noiſome Dungeon, and there became Dropſical. They drew him from thence to carry him to <hi>Valence,</hi> and put him into the hands of <hi>Rapine,</hi> which is the laſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to which they put the Faith of the Martyrs of that Country. <hi>Rapine</hi> drew near to him with the countenance of a Lyon, and with words like roaring, concluding, <hi>We will ſee whether thou wilt be ſo obſtinate in my hands.</hi> He put him into the entry of a Chamber, under which ran all the ſinks of the Hoſpital, even thoſe of the Bogg-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Jaques; and for a bed, they gave him a Plank. This place was oppoſite by another little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the Chappel of the Hoſpital, where they ſaid Maſs every day; they would have obliged our Martyr to have aſſiſted at the Maſs by this entry, but they could never effect it. All theſe evil treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not being able to vanquiſh this illuſtrious Confeſſor, <hi>Rapine</hi> comes to his laſt Remedies; he cauſed Monſieur <hi>Menurett</hi> to deſcend into the Court, where there was a Mulberry-tree, and faſtned his arms on high thereto, his feet ſcarce touching the ground; he rent off his Cloaths to his very Shirt, and cauſed him to receive an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of blows with a Bull's piſle: this treatment was continued for the ſpace of fifteen days, with ſo much violence, that our Martyr voided blood by his Urine, and by all the parts of his body.
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:49990:269"/>In the midſt of theſe horrible Torments, without ceaſing, he beg'd mercy and grace from God for himſelf, and for his Perſecutors, and implored the compaſſion of his Hangmen in ſo moving a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that two <hi>Capuchines,</hi> who heard his cries, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>Rapine</hi> to ceaſe his cruel puniſhment; he did ſo, and was content to employ our Martyr to carry ſtones for a building which they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at the Hoſpital. The firſt day of <hi>April</hi> laſt, the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> went to viſit him in this ſtinking Sink, but gained no more upon him at this time, than at others. In concluſion, <hi>Rapine</hi> inraged with his long oppoſition, entred like a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil into the Priſon of this holy man, accompanied with two Lacques, or Serjeants, and gave him ſo many blows with a Bull's piſle, and for ſo long a time, that the cries of the Martyr did even rend the Air all round about. This Monſter about two hours after, (after he had been wearied with the pains that he had taken to martarize this Saint) return'd with his Searjeants, to repeat the puniſhment; but he found our Martyr expired in the midſt of theſe cruel torments. He was put into the hands of <hi>Rapine</hi> in the month of <hi>June</hi> 1686, and died in the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1687. I cannot tell whether after this, they will have the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to maintain, that all theſe Cruelties which have been exerciſed, have not been authorized by the Miniſters of his Majeſty, and the Judges, nor by the commandment of the Dragoons; but that they are the Violences of the Souldiery, which have been condemned and puniſhed when they have been known. <hi>Rapine</hi> is neither Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier nor Dragoon, he has no Commiſſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe theſe Cruelties, but ſuch as he receives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day: He is Guardian of the Hoſpital of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi>
                  <pb n="518" facs="tcp:49990:270"/>The <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Greenoble</hi> have ſent him twenty five or twenty ſix perſons at a time, as I ſaid but juſt now, to be converted by theſe cruel Methods. The Biſhop, and the Jeſuites put into his hands all thoſe upon whom they cannot prevail: But to the end that they may not ſay any more, that Authority does not interpoſe in theſe Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, they ought to be informed of a memorable ſtory happening at <hi>Uzes,</hi> and which I think has been atteſted by twenty <hi>Letters</hi> of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all which agree in the thing: There is at <hi>Uzes</hi> a Houſe of Propagation, governed by four Creatures, called the <hi>Daughters of the Propagation;</hi> in this Houſe are many Gentlewomen of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, impriſoned, who have reſiſted preceeding Violences and Temptations: One of theſe four <hi>Daughters of the Propagation</hi> went to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Intendant, of the rough anſwers which theſe poor perſecuted Gentlewomen gave, and of the ſmall diſpoſition they had to be converted. The Intendant, Monſieur <hi>d' Bauille,</hi> whoſe name for his conduct in <hi>Languedock,</hi> deſerves to live to all future Ages, this Intendant, I ſay, immediately appointed Scourging againſt ten of the moſt intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable. In the execution of this command, four Souldiers were ſet at the Gate with Muſquets charged, and lighted Matches, ready to give fire. Two Prieſts went in with the Major of <hi>Viuon,</hi> and the Judge <hi>Larnac,</hi> Sub-delegate to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: in their preſence theſe Creatures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, ſtript theſe Gentlewomen from the Girdle upward, and doing the Office of Hangman, ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them after the moſt cruel manner, with ſtraps made of Coards, at the end of which hung Bullets of Lead; afterwards they were thrown into a dark Priſon. During the time of this puniſhment, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:49990:270"/>cries which were heard into the ſtreet; but they encouraged each other to ſuffer theſe Tryals for the Name of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will at this time tell you no more ſad News, but on the contrary, I will comfort you by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you to underſtand, that in this general Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, wherein the Reformed Church of <hi>France</hi> ſees ſo many perſons, in ſome ſort fall under the Temptation, we have the joy to know, that ſcarce one falls in love with this wicked Religion. We have taken care to enquire concerning it, of thoſe which came from all parts; and we have cauſed enquiries to be made upon the places, as much as is poſſible for us; but we can aſſure you, my Brethren, as a thing certain, that the hatred of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion increaſes every day, inſomuch that the Perſecutors are farther every day from accompliſhing their deſigns, than ever: We may ſay, without fear of lying, or hyperbole of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that this Perſecution has not gained to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> two hundred hearty Converts; and although I know a vaſt number of perſons have been prevailed withal to make their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, yet the number of thoſe, which have with a ſatisfied Judgment embraced their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſo ſmall, that it does not deſerve to be computed. But on the contrary, by a ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing marvel of Divine Providence, this Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has opened the eyes of a great number of ancient Catholicks, as they are called. That which we tell you, is no Conjecture or Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis that which we know upon good Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: So that it is certain, that the Church of GOD has gained more Souls than it has loſt. Theſe Seeds will bring forth in their time. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day we ſee perſons arrive here, who Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:49990:271"/>the Roman Religion; and amongſt them there are ſuch as are eminent by their Merit, by their Birth, by their Parts, and by their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When we know that they will not take it ill, if we name them, we will do it; for 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all the World know it, that the depths of Divine Providence, and His Judgments may be admired thereby.</p>

            <p>WE have already ſeen one eſſential thing in which the Fourth and Fifth Ages had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no alteration; 'tis the Opinion concerning the Nature of the Sacrifice of the Euchariſt. We ſhall now ſee that the Faith of the Church did not change in the Point of the Real Preſence, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. This Article being long, we ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into two. And we ſhall ſee at this time, that the Fathers did believe as we do, that the Sacrament of the Euchariſt was nothing but an efficacious Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>As they perſevered in the cuſtom of calling the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, a Sacrifice and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they continued alſo in a cuſtom much more ancient, ſince it deſcended from Jeſus Chriſt and his
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:49990:272"/>Apoſtles, that is, to call the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, <hi>the Body, the Fleſh, the true Fleſh, and the Blood of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> They ſaid then, <hi>that we eat the Fleſh of our Lord Jeſus; that we really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; that Jeſus Christ hath given his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink; that it is truly his Fleſh, and truly his Blood; that we may not doubt, that Jeſus Christ doth not give what he promiſed,</hi> viz. <hi>his Fleſh and his Blood; nor that the Bread is not the Body of Christ; that Jeſus Christ, who changed Water into Wine, could eaſily change the Bread into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood; that we must communicate with a full certainty, as in the Body of Jeſus Christ; that Jeſus Christ, who is the inviſible Prieſt, changes the viſible Creatures into the ſubſtance of his Body and of his Blood.</hi> After all that which they quote unto you of moſt ſtrength concerning the Article of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt for Tranſubſtantiation and the Real Preſence in the fourth and fifth Ages amounts to this.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, what doth all this ſignifie? Is there any thing therein of more ſtrength than that which Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſaid? The Lord ſaid, <hi>My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed, this, or this Bread is my Body.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Bread which you break is our Communion in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That which is under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is to know how they underſtood this, and if we prove, that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the Bread continueth Bread, being nevertheleſs changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, if we prove that they meant the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is the Sign, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Means by which the efficacy of his Death is applied unto our Souls; it is certain, that we have ruined all the advantages that can be drawn from theſe high Expreſſions. In like manner, if we can prove, that the Fathers of the fourth and
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:49990:272"/>fifth Ages did underſtand that the Bread and Wine became the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and are changed into his Fleſh and Blood, becauſe they are the Sacraments, the Signs, the Figures, the Images, and the Means by which God doth communicate the vertue of his Fleſh, and the efficacy of his Death, without any change happening in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof; if, ſay I, the Fathers of theſe Ages declare this plainly, it is obvious, that they cannot draw any advantage from all theſe Expreſſions, how high ſoever they appear; now I take it for granted, that they could not declare themſelves more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereon, than they have done, as we ſhall hear hereafter.</p>
            <p>And to the end that their Declarations may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us more expreſs and ſignificant, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that you be acquainted with one thing, of which your Converters are at an agreement with us, and by conſequence I need not prove unto you; and 'tis this, in theſe Ages it was the cuſtom to hide the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries not only from Unbelievers, but alſo from the Catechumens which had not as yet communicated. This conduct had two Reaſons or Foundations, the firſt was the deſign to increaſe the reſpect which they deſired Chriſtians ſhould retain for theſe Myſteries; the ſecond was an earneſt paſſion to diminiſh the contempt which the <hi>Pagans</hi> had for a Myſtery wherein nothing was ſeen but Bread and Wine. Theſe two Conſiderations obliged them never to ſpeak of the Sacrament but in obſcure and dark words. They deſired never to name the Bread and Wine; as much as they could they ſerved themſelves of <hi>Periphraſes,</hi> ſaying ſometimes, <hi>that which you well underſtand,</hi> ſometimes <hi>that which the Prieſt takes,</hi> ſometimes <hi>the nouriſhment made of many Grains, and the drink drawn from many Grapes,</hi> or ſomething of like ſort. This was, in my opinion, the meaneſt
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:49990:273"/>ſubtilty in the World. For in deſpight to all their Precautions, every body knew, that they took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt, and they themſelves ſaid it oftentimes contrary to the deſign which they had of ſaying nothing concerning it. But at laſt the deſign of hiding the matter of the Sacrament engaged them to ſpeak nothing of it but in dark terms, and always to ſerve themſelves of the myſtical terms, of <hi>the Body, the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>the Blood</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and always to uſe theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and always to avoid thoſe that were plain and without figure, as much as they were able. So that when it happens, that they call the Signs by their name, and to ſpeak to things as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one only paſſage is more worth than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, where they ſpeak figuratively and myſtically. For this myſtical Language was among them a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of neceſſity, and duty which they had impoſed upon themſelves, whereas when they ſpake of things plainly and nakedly, 'twas the Language of truth, 'twas the Language of the Heart and Soul which reſcu'd it ſelf from politick ſlavery and bondage. It will not be therefore amazing, if we find few paſſages in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, where the truth of the opinion of the Fathers was plainly expreſſed. Nevertheleſs, we find ſo many of them, and ſo plain, that 'tis not conceivable how prejudice hinders our adverſaries from ſeeing the truth in this caſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, altho' we had no other paſſages of the Fathers, but thoſe where they call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Figure,</hi> the <hi>Sign,</hi> the <hi>Image,</hi> the <hi>Symbols,</hi> of the Body and Blood of the Lord, theſe were enough. Now of theſe there is almoſt an infinite number, what other things do we ſay thereof, than that the Sacrament is the Figure, the Sign, and the Symbol of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? why did they ſay the ſame thing with us, if they had not the ſame thoughts

                  <hi>An Article of Controverſie.</hi> An Anſwer to the Prejudices which ſome perſons have raiſed againſt our Separation from the Actions, the Conduct, and the Perſonal Qualities of the Authors thereof.</head>
               <p>WE have finiſhed our Anſwer to the Sophiſms which they propoſe unto you on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Separation, by making it evident to you, that it does not hazard your ſalvation, that it was neceſſary, and that it was juſt. But before we paſs to other Queſtions which reſpect the Church, we muſt ſay ſomething concerning thoſe who made this Separation; for 'tis the moſt fruitful Source and Fountain of Illuſions, and a Subject of perpetual Harangues and Declamations. And this we owe eſpecially to a Woman of Quality, among thoſe which are called new Converts, who places the little Edification that our Reformers have given to the World, or rather the Scandal which they have given to it by their Conduct and Diviſions, as one of the Reaſons which hath moſt affected her, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her to embrace the Roman Religion. 'Tis a ſubject on which an infinite number of Books have been made, to which I might ſend you, were it not that Books are taken from you for the moſt part; beſides, my deſigne being to ſpare you the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of reading great Books, I am to abridge and reduce what our Authors have ſaid thereon, to the compaſs and extent of a Letter. Behold then the Accuſations which they form againſt the Authors of the Separation, which I have juſtified in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Letters. 1. That theſe pretended Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:49990:275"/>did no Miracles, to ſupport their extraordinary Miſſion and their new Goſpel. 2. That they led a ſcandalous life, and ſuch as had no conformity with the Spirit of a Reformed Goſpel, which they boaſted to bring into the World. 3. That there appears in their Expreſſions a dark Malignity, and an implacable Hatred againſt the Roman Church, and that their Books are full of cruel Injuries both againſt the Roman Religion, and againſt its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, a thing abſolutely contrary to the Spirit of Charity. 4. That they are divided into three Sects, of which <hi>Zuinglius, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Heads. That if the Spirit of God had ſent them to Reform the Church, he would alſo have united them in this great deſign, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with the ſame thoughts, and the ſame apprehenſions. 5. To conclude, they ſay, that they have rent and torn each other by tranſports of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which are the true Characters of falſe Paſtors, and falſe Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Objection, I cannot avoid baptizing it by its own name, and calling it an Impertinence. Why ſhould our Reformers work Miracles, and why were they obliged thereunto? When <hi>Jehu</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> pull'd down the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Baal,</hi> broke in pieces his Statues, rooted out his Prophets, and aboliſhed his Worſhip, did he work Miracles, or had he any need thereof? Was it any ſpot to that Holy Reformation, that <hi>Joſiah</hi> made, when he re-eſtabliſhed the Service of God, which was almoſt wholly under a heap of forreign Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that he wrought no Miracles? When <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Great reformed the Chriſtian Church, and drove away Arianiſm, which was become the reigning Religion, did he do Miracles, or had he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny need thereof? There is no need to work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but when men bring a new Religion, and a
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:49990:276"/>new Revelation. For that reaſon the Apoſtles wrought Miracles, becauſe they had a new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to propoſe to the World. They brought a Goſpel unknown to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and oppoſite to the prejudices of the one and the other. We brought no new Goſpel into the World, we propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Old and the New Teſtament; the one and the other were received, without contradiction, by all thoſe Chriſtians which we deſired to reform. When it ſhall pleaſe God to convert the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſtianity, according to his promiſes, there is much probability that he will ſend them ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which will work Miracles, and that will be neceſſary. For although the Goſpel-Revelation be already manifeſted, and we have the Books of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, nevertheleſs this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with reſpect to the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe they do not eſteem our Books Canonical, but believe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to be Cheats and Impoſtors. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need of new Miracles to recover them from their prejudices, and oblige them to give attention to the truth. But as for us, it was in no wiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to work Miracles to eſtabliſh that Book whereof we ſerved our ſelves. Otherwiſe, as often as the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> produced the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to make Reformation in their Church, they had been obliged to work Miracles. They had nothing elſe to do, but to produce the Book, and make it evident, that the Abominations which had been introduced into Religion, were either forbidden, or not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there. Behold all that they had to do; behold all that we have to do; and 'tis to miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Conduct of God, and the Spirit of the Goſpel, to imagine that the truth cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to Unbelievers, but by Miracles. How many millions of men have been converted to Chriſtianity, ſince the days of the Apoſtles, and the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:49990:276"/>ceſſation of the gift of Miracles? Miracles are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to deliver men from their evil prejudices, and to endue them with ſuch as are good, that they may hearken to the truth: Men that believe not the Chriſtian Religion, but only for the ſake of its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, are very ill-Chriſtians. And among thoſe which became Converts by the preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, thoſe who had no other reaſon to embrace this New Religion, but the Miracles which they ſaw done by thoſe which preacht it, were very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Converts; ſuch perſons are the ſeed of Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and adhere to the Church but by a very feeble root. We ought to adhere to it for the love of truth, now 'tis the knowledge of the truth, and not the ſight of Miracles, which gives birth to the love thereof. If Miracles be not neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Unbelievers, with far greater reaſon they cannot be of neceſſity for the bringing back of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Chriſtians to the right way. For there needs no more, but to ſhew them the holy Scripture, which ſo exactly marks out the path in which they ought to walk. As to what they ſay, that thoſe who will eſtabliſh a new Miniſtry, muſt have Miracles for the ſupport of it, 'tis an Affair to be treated on elſewhere. We have already ſaid ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, and we ſhall have yet farther occaſion to ſpeak of it, and ſhew that we have no more eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a new Miniſtry, than we have introduced a new Goſpel. Where there is no new Revelation, there is no new Miniſtry; our Miniſtry is that of the Apoſtles, becauſe our Doctrine is theirs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Accuſation which they make againſt the Authors of our Seperation, is their Scandalous Life. There is no probability, ſay your Converts, that God ſhould ſuffer ſo ſtrange an Alliance, as that would be, of a great abundance of the Spirit of Light on the one part, and of ſo great diſorders of
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:49990:277"/>Manners on the other. And thereon they publiſh a hundred ugly ſtories to cry down the Memory of <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Martyr, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt we ſay, that truth is truth, without any dependance on thoſe who declare it. Your Converters have ſaid ſomewhere, That <hi>the Citizens of.</hi> Babel <hi>may ſometimes build</hi> Jeruſalem. 'Tis a truth ſo certain, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, a man muſt be ignorant and falſe: For in all Ages there have been very Evil men, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the part of truth, and who have even main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it againſt Hereticks, whoſe Conduct and Manners have been very regular, and oftentimes more edifying than that of the Orthodox. We muſt not form a prejudice againſt the Doctrine, upon the ill Conduct of thoſe which preach it; we muſt judge of Truth by it ſelf. So that although it ſhould be true, that our Reformers were ſuch as they report them, nevertheleſs it would behove us to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Citizens of <hi>Babel</hi> were not the Builders of <hi>Zion.</hi> But God forbid that we ſhould have no other fortification to defend our ſelves. We have made to appear the innocence of the Lives of the Authors of our Separation, by Apologies of ſo much ſtrength, that their Calumniators have been covered with Confuſion; and the moſt part of our moſt reſolved Enemies have been obliged to renounce them. The <hi>Bolſacs,</hi> the <hi>Bertheliers,</hi> the <hi>Florimond de Raymonds,</hi> and other like Calumniators, ought to be the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Execration of all Honeſt men. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Legitimate Prejudices againſt the <hi>Calva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> and other like Authors, who are willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves in the Eſteem of Honeſt men, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and eſtabliſh themſelves upon notorious matters of fact, ſuch is for example, Marriage of Prieſts. Perſons who have made a Vow of Chaſtity, ſay they, and who were obliged to celibate by ſo many Oaths, have violated their Vows in the face of the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:49990:277"/>Sun; they have opened Cloyſters to take Wives from thence, and ſo have committed a double Adultery againſt Chriſt Jeſus. Theſe are pitiful Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to my apprehenſion. To judge of the nature of theſe Actions, we muſt know what were the Principles of thoſe who did them. Why ſhould they obſerve Celibacy, ſince they lookt upon it as a Yoak of which they deſired to deliver the Clergy, becauſe it had produced a world of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Abominations, ſo that a Deluge was not capable of purging them? They have broken their Vows. They were unlawful Vows, made under a tyrannical Empire, conceived in a falſe Religion, unacceptable to God, becauſe they ſerved as a Vail to an infinite number of Corruptions, and at the ſame time to a debaucht and hypocritical life. They forſook <hi>Babylon,</hi> and it behoved them to forſake all the Badges thereof. This kind of life, which under an appearance of Piety hides ſuch great Diſorders, is the true Character of the Beaſt. Theſe Monks are thoſe Hypocrites whoſe <hi>Conſciences are ſeared as with a hot Iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from Meats which God hath permitted;</hi> which teach a Doctrine of Devils, and ſerve as a Support to the Throne of the Beaſt. So that theſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers being delivered from the tyrannical Yoak of this unhappy Empire, ought to return to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their Rights, and of all their Liberty; and being put in the poſſeſſion of it, they may and ought to uſe it. There needs but one thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all theſe Calumniators, who are willing to ſtain and blacken the Lives of the Authors of our Reformation: What have theſe Reformers gained, what have they gotten, to do the work of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors? Have they gained Riches, Honours, or great Dignities? Have they left great Houſes, have they left Heirs, and Children that were great Lords?
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:49990:278"/>Never did perſons deſpiſe their own Intereſts more than they did, they never got wherewithal to be buried decently, and ſcarcely got wherewith to live. Their Zeal, Firmneſs, Conſtancy, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, joyned with a contempt of their own Intereſt, make up a Character very oppoſite to that of diſhoneſt men. If they had been debauched effeminate Lovers of Pleaſure, why did they go out of the Body of the Roman Clergy, who enjoyed all the pleaſures of the fleſh, even thoſe which were moſt infamous, with ſo much convenience and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Theſe Gentlemen ſay, that the principal reaſon which gave ſuch ſucceſs to the New Goſpel, was the licentiouſneſs of the Church-men and the Monks of that Age. This is it which that ſame Lady does confeſs, who makes the ill Converſation of the Authors of our Separation, one cauſe of her return to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But this Confeſſion and this Truth which is publickly known, doth it not utterly ruine the Accuſation which the Papiſts make againſt our Reformers? Is there any probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that the great number of people, which forſook the Roman Church, being ſcandalized by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Lives of its Guides, ſhould liſt themſelves under the Enſigns of other wicked perſons, which were no better than thoſe they had forſaken? If they were not vicious and debaucht, at leaſt, ſay they, they were fierce, proud, Lovers of themſelves, paſſionate, ambitious, vain, and violent. Theſe are ſtroaks ſtriken in the Air, and Accuſations which make it evident they have nothing to ſay. Concerning Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, there doth not appear any footſtep thereof in their Converſation. And that which they call Pride and Fierceneſs, is according to us, Zeal and Vigour in the maintenance of Truth, as we ſhall make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it appear in examining the third Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="535" facs="tcp:49990:278"/>
The third Accuſation is, that it's evident the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our Separation were inſpired with a dark Malignity againſt the Roman Church; they vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt her, ſay they, flouds of Injuries, and every-where is to be ſeen a Character of black Gholer, which diſcharges it ſelf both upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Religion. They ſupport and ſtrengthen this Accuſation by the Confeſſion of ſome Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who were of another frame and temper of mind, and did not approve thoſe methods of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure that were ſo full of flame and fire. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That Grace which changes mens Manners, does not change their Temper and Conſtitution, but governs and ſerves it ſelf thereof. Although it ſhould be true, that there appeared a great deal of fire in the Authors of our Reformation, that would be no ſufficient cauſe to condemn them, it being the temper of all Great men. And this temper is of ſo great neceſſity for the execution of great things, that without it 'tis very difficult to carry on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute great Deſigns and Enterprizes. This is a thing unto which thoſe men have too little regard, which at this day do ſo highly commend, and advance the Elogies of ſweetneſs and moderation in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and who perſwade us to imitate other Great men, who are of a quite contrary Character, and temper of Mind. If theſe honeſt men of this laſt Order, that is to ſay, theſe ſoft and moderate men, had been born in the paſt Age, and had been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in that great Work, they had neither maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor carried it ſo far, as did thoſe men, the heat of whoſe Temper they would fain make a Crime. If <hi>Luther</hi> had not had a heart fearleſs, and of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable courage, he had never been able to bear up againſt the Torrent of Contradictions and Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he met withal, and repelled. Father <hi>Paul</hi> the famous <hi>Venetian</hi> Divine, who became famous
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:49990:279"/>on occaſion of the Affair of the Interdict of that Republick, knew aſſuredly the Corruption of the Roman Church, at leaſt as well as <hi>Luther:</hi> He made no ſecret of it, no eminent Proteſtant paſſed by <hi>Venice,</hi> to whom he did not diſcover himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. They often repreſented to him, that he was obliged in Conſcience to break with a Church, the Impurity and Idolatry whereof he ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. He had a thouſand Reaſons to offer on his own behalf: ſometimes that he ſeparated the good from the bad, ſometimes that he was of uſe to a thouſand perſons that lay hid, and had good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; at laſt when he was preſſed hard, he would ſay, that God had not given to him the Heart and Spirit of <hi>Luther.</hi> It is certain, that if Father <hi>Paul</hi> had been of the Temper and Spirit of <hi>Luther, Venice</hi> had been at this day what <hi>Geneva</hi> is. And it is alſo certain, that if <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> had been of the Temper and Spirit of Father <hi>Paul,</hi> all <hi>Europe</hi> had been yet what <hi>Venice</hi> is at this day. It behoves us therefore to admire the great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Wiſdom of God, who choſe for ſo great a Work, men whoſe Temper was fit to maintain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and exerciſe Zeal effectually. To this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration add another; the Authors of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation have indeed ſpoken ill of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of its Prieſts, of its High-Prieſt, of its Monks, and its Guides. And why might they not ſpeak ill of them? I do maintain, that they ſaid nothing but what was true; they could ſcarcely ſpeak too much ill of Popery. They ſaid, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was myſtick <hi>Babylon;</hi> that ſhe was a famous Harlot; that ſhe was a debaucht Adultereſs; that her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were Dogs and Swine. This was true. There was nothing in the World ſo corrupt as the Roman Clergy. <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all her Members are the Inhabitants of <hi>Babel.</hi> Was this a time to ſpeak
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:49990:279"/>things by halves? What reaſon had they to flatter <hi>Rome?</hi> Ought they not to paint her in all her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that they might make her odious? If it had been poſſible to exceed in the deſcription of her, that had been more pardonable, than the tenderneſs of thoſe who abate her uglineſs by their ſmooth and ſoft Pencils. It was then expedient to awaken men who were in ſo deep a ſleep, and in order thereunto 'twas neceſſary to ſpeak loud. And after all, theſe Gentlemen have but little reaſon to reproach us with the Violences and Injuries of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> that is little, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the Rage which that Church has exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd againſt us. The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> call the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters and Swine, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> returning a thouſand Injuries more ſevere, add thereunto Cruelties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the moſt barbarous Nations. They burnt them by a ſlow fire, they hanged and quartered them, they cauſed them to die in Priſons by unheard-of puniſhments, they hunted after them as after <hi>Lions</hi> and <hi>Bears.</hi> Although there ſhould have been ſomething humane in the heat of our firſt Reformers, had it been very ſurprizing, that men whom they burnt, which they rent and tore in pieces, ſhould grow into ſome little choler againſt their Perſecutors? Let the preſent Conduct of thoſe who at this day would form a prejudice in the minds of the New Converts, on the occaſion of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport and heat of our Reformers, be lookt into and examined. Theſe Gentlemen have addreſſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Letters unto us, with a Quill dipt in Gall, and afterwards have ſheathed their Swords in our breaſts and bowels. They condemn to death thoſe who exerciſe any other Religion but that of <hi>Rome.</hi> They drag the Bodies of thoſe to the Dung-hill, who die refuſing to embrace their Doctrine. They ſend thoſe to the Gallies, who will not ſubmit unto it.
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:49990:280"/>They cauſe thoſe who will not ſubſcribe to their Superſtitions, to be burnt, torn in pieces, eaten up, and devoured by their Dragoons: Thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them by the Weapons of the Word of God, they ſent for Slaves into the other World. And after this, they tell you, your pretended Reformers were violent and paſſionate perſons; they could not be the Meſſengers of God, for God is Love and Kindneſs. Tell them on this ſubject, you cannot be the Miniſters of God, for you do the Work of the Devil, and the Father of Lies, who was a Lyer and a Murderer from the beginning.</p>
               <p>But behold a new Accuſation founded on this, that the Authors of our Separation poured out their Gall not only againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt their own Brethren. The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all Orders take a great deal of pleaſure in heaping together all the injuries which the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have ſaid againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they have found therein the marks of Reprobation. On this ſubject we have anſwered, That we condemn theſe tranſport, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them oppoſite to a Spirit of Charity. We ſay, that the Authors of our Separation did not utterly ſtrip themſelves of all that was Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; that they did retain ſome tinctures of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> from whence they came, which were blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and ſpots in their conduct and converſation: Impatience, fury, and tranſport againſt thoſe who oppoſe themſelves to their ſentiments, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them, is the Spirit of <hi>Popery,</hi> and particularly that of the Monks. This is certain, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church treats all her Enemies as Devils, damned, reprobate, excommunicated Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Let a man read the Hiſtory of <hi>Popery,</hi> and he will ſee theſe furies reigning every-where: let him obſerve what bloody and cruel Tragedies,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:49990:280"/>the Monks ſtirred up a little before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on ſubject of the form of their Hoods; and of the Queſtion concerning the property of thoſe Commodities and Goods which the Friers Minors ſpent. The thing proceeded even to fire, for the Popes cauſed ſome of theſe poor Monks to be burnt, who obſtinately maintained, that what the Minors ſpent, was not their own. What is the injuſtice of the Inquiſition againſt thoſe who are guilty of the leaſt contradictions to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of <hi>Rome?</hi> Let a man read the Furies of the Popes, when they had Oppoſites, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popes. Let him read the frightful Bulls of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications againſt Kings, Princes, States, and perſons, who had the boldneſs to oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the torrent of Corruption, and the attempts of Tyranny. 'Tis from thence that the impatience and paſſion into which the Reformers fell againſt one another, in the maintaining their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did derive: 'Tis from the ſame tincture of <hi>Popery,</hi> that ſome of them took thoſe harſh methods of procedure, which they believed they might take againſt Hereticks. So that if theſe tranſports, and this impatience of ſuffering, with reſpect to their Brethren, hath been in our Reformers a mark of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, 'tis unavoidable that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is reprobate, and the Synagogue of Satan; for 'tis ſhe that inſpired this Spirit into thoſe which came out of her boſom. We ſay alſo, that in all Ages men have been made much after the ſame faſhion, they have grown into heat, and tranſport one againſt another upon very light occaſions, even to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ſcandalous Schiſms. The Biſhops aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to condemn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Arrius,</hi> tore one another, and gave Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to ruine each others reputation. <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to reconcile them, thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:49990:281"/>to throw their Papers into the fire, without reading them. We learn from the Writings of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that the Orthodox, who agreed in the ſence of the Doctrines againſt <hi>Arrius,</hi> diſagreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves about the words <hi>Subſtance, Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Hypoſtaſis;</hi> ſome being willing it ſhould be ſaid there were three <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> in the Deity; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſaying, That it was an Hereſie, becauſe it was to make three Gods. The <hi>Luciferians,</hi> who with all the Church were enemies to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> ſuffered themſelves to run into the higheſt paſſions againſt thoſe who were willing to receive the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Biſhops, and permit them in their Sees, after their repentance. The Controverſies of <hi>St. Cyril</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> who called each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Traytors, and <hi>Judaſes,</hi> have been already quoted to theſe Gentlemen. Examples of this ſort taken from the moſt happy Ages, and ſuch as were neareſt to the fountain of Charity, have been quoted to them, as the tranſport of <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who treated <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> as a <hi>falſe Christ,</hi> a <hi>falſe Apoſtle,</hi> and a <hi>deceitful Worker; St. Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Firmilian,</hi> the Adverſaries of <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hand ſaid concerning him, That he was <hi>wicked, obſtinate, preſumptuous, proud, inhumane, bold, inſolent, ſchiſmatical, fooliſh, inept, blind, and ſmitten with a Spirit of Giddineſs.</hi> To conclude, their own Authors have been quoted to them, who in theſe laſt times, on the ſubject of ſome Diſputes about Grace, have ſpoken againſt each other, a thouſand and a thouſand heinous Calumnies. Therefore if eagerneſs and tranſport againſt Brethren, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a mark of Reprobation, 'tis unavoidably that <hi>St. Epiphanius, Jerome, Cyril, Chryſoſtome,</hi> as well as all the Hero's of <hi>Popery,</hi> be eſteemed Reprobates. This is enough to make it evident, that inſtead of drawing prejudices againſt Doctrine, from the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:49990:281"/>faults of thoſe who teach it, we ought to admire the profound Wiſdom of God, who ſerves himſelf of weak Inſtruments to execute great things, who leaves in men the faults of their temper, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs fails not to uſe them profitably, in his great Work of building up <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the end that all the glory may be of God, and not of us, and that we may have reaſon to ſay, <hi>We have this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, the laſt Accuſation is founded on the difference of ſentiments in which the Authors of our Separation were found, with reſpect to ſome points. <hi>I conſider,</hi> writes the Lady of whom we have ſpoken, <hi>I conſider,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>three men which appeared almoſt in the ſame time, who attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church, in the mean while could not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves in the moſt eſſential points.</hi> If a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had a mind well formed and faſhioned, as it ought to be, inſtead of being ſcandalized at this, that the Reformers were at a difference about ſome Articles, he would be edified by this, that they were at an agreement in ſo many. I am troubled at this, that they were not at an agreement in all; but I much more admire this, that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, as it appears by their Controverſies with each other, they agreed in ſo many points; and I look on it as an evident proof that God guided them in this great Work. For 'tis certain, that if they had been inſpired by a ſpirit purely Humane, as all the Patrons of Hereſies have been, they would have agreed in nothing, but in the general deſign of troubling the Peace of the Church. Let a man read the Hiſtory of Hereſies, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and he will ſee, that they made Sects and Parties that differed in every thing; the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the <hi>Entychians,</hi> the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians,</hi> and a hundred others: They might agree
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:49990:282"/>in certain points, as the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> might agree in the Hereſie of two Principles, but it was with ſuch enormous differences, that it was viſible they could not be guided by one and the ſame Spirit. But I intreat you, by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent did the Authors of our Separation, agree to condemn in <hi>Popery,</hi> the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the taking away of the Cup, Tranſubſtantiation, the Adoration of the Euchariſt; the Proceſſion of the Sacrament, private Maſſes, Purgatory, Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Humane Satisfactions, the Adoration of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Invocation of Saints, the Worſhip of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Monaſtick Vows, the Pope, and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Tyranny, a barbarous Language in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, Prayers for the Dead, falſe Sacraments, the abuſe of Eccleſiaſtical Power, the Merit of Works, Works of Supererrogation, Pilgrimages, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous Devotions to the Bleſſed Virgin, Legends, Inſtitution of divers Orders of Monks, Miracles, the Infallibility of the Church, the ſupreme Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or Councils over Conſciences, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the pretended imperfection, obſcurity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to read it. This is the object to which we ought to give attention, that we may admire and ſay, it muſt be, that all this be falſe, wicked, vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of ſuch corruption as is plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſince men that were at no agreement or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence among themſelves, yea, who divided, and oftentimes evil intreated each other, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and be at good accord therein. Indeed 'tis a thing which we can never admire enough, that men who were no Prophets, nor inſpired perſons, nor led by an infallible Spirit, ſhould condemn in <hi>Popery,</hi> not that which continues of Chriſtianity there, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fundamental Doctrines contained in the Creed, but preciſely, and only all the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:49990:282"/>Additions, yea, and that one and the ſame Additions. Wherefore did not one of them take one part of <hi>Popery,</hi> and reject another? Why, without any correſpondence, did they treat as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, all theſe pieces patched on to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity? Why did they agree, that we ought to receive only the Word of God for the Rule of our Faith? Why, and how did they agree ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably in the Interpretation of this Word of God? If a man does not acknowledge ſomething Divine therein, he muſt be ſmitten with a ſpirit of Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But they are not at an agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner how the Bread in the Euchariſt is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Behold a thing very amazing, that among a hundred and a hundred points, in which they are agreed, there ſhould be one in which they could not come to an accord: Moreover, <hi>Popery</hi> cannot reaſonably draw any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from this diſſention; for if they be not at an agreement among themſelves, they agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Opinion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church therein. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> have nothing in this point in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> 'tis a thing which we ſhall make plain to you one day. This is therefore but one point againſt a hundred: Is this worthy of conſideration, and thereof to make a Stumbling-block, and a Scandal?</p>
               <p>But however it be, ſome will ſay, how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſoever it may appear, 'tis the Foundation of a Schiſm; the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and the Reformed make two different Communions. On this ſubject, and in general of all the Faults which are obſerved in the Authors of the Separation, ſuch as paſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of heat, quarrels, diviſions, controverſies, too too warmly managed, injuries, and calumnies; and to conclude, the Schiſm which their Succeſſours live in among themſelves: 'Tis fit to admire the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:49990:283"/>providence of God, and to bring hither the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reflections of Mr. <hi>Paſchal,</hi> ſaying with him, <hi>A man will never underſtand any thing in the Works of God, if he do not lay down this as a Principle, That He does illuminate ſome, and blind others.</hi> Hear the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this Maxim, given by himſelf,<note n="*" place="margin">Thoughts of Mr. <hi>Paſchal,</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God hath been willing to Redeem Men, and to open the Door of Salvation to thoſe that ſearch it; but Men make themſelves ſo unworthy, that it's juſt that He refuſe to ſome, becauſe of their Hardneſs and Impenitency, that which He grants to others by a Mercy that is not due unto them. If He had pleaſed to ſurmount the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the moſt hardned, He could have done it by diſcovering himſelf ſo manifeſtly unto them, that they ſhould not have doubted of the truth of his Exiſtence, and ſo will appear at the laſt day, even with ſuch a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and brightneſs, that the moſt blind ſhall ſee him: It was not his pleaſure to appear after this manner in eſtates of Grief and Humiliation; becauſe ſo many men making themſelves unworthy of his Clemency, it was his will to leave them deprived of thoſe good things which they would not have. It was not therefore juſt that he ſhould appear after a manner ſo manifeſtly Divine, and abſolutely capable of convincing all men; but neither was it juſt, that he ſhould come after ſo ſecret a manner, that he could not be known by thoſe that ſincerely ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: He communicates light enough for thoſe that deſire to ſee, and obſcurity enough for thoſe that have a contrary diſpoſition; brightneſs enough to enlighten the Elect, and darkneſs enough to humble them, obſcurity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to blind Reprobates, and light enough to condemn and make them inexcuſable.</hi> This is the true Key of Providence; Light and Darkneſs throughout, is exactly the Character of the Word of God, of his Myſteries, and of his Conduct. 'Tis not the Will of God, that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould fall all at a time;

The <hi>Latine</hi> Church before the full or entire Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was to be divided into <hi>Papiſts, Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Reformed:</hi> God to accompliſh this deſign, came to Reform the Church the firſt time by mixing dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with light. There is light enough to ſave humble minds, and there is darkneſs enough to offend and ſcandalize the proud. The Evidence of the Teſtimonies of the Word of God, which the Authors of our Separation did diſcover; the Ughlineſs of the Corruption of <hi>Popery,</hi> which they did obſerve; the Zeal with which they began this Work; the admirable Succeſs with which they carried it on; the unanimous Accord in which they were to retain Chriſtianity, and reject <hi>Popery,</hi> all this, ſay I, forms the light in this great Event: but their Diviſions, private Quarrels, humane Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the ſad Schiſm found among them, make that Obſcurity that God hath permitted, becauſe his Deſign was not to throw <hi>Popery</hi> down to the ground all at once. It is of neceſſity therefore, that thoſe who have any care of their Salvation, give attention to the light to maintain and ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and that they ſerve themſelves with the obſcurities for their Humiliation and Abaſement: 'Tis neceſſary that they admire the Finger of God in this great Work; and that they admire it ſo much the more, becauſe he hath accompliſhed it by Inſtruments ſo weak and feeble. If you give attention to all this, I may aſſure you, that you will find wherewith to ſatisfie yourſelves, in all thoſe Scruples they put into your minds on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Authors of our Separation.</p>
               <p>If you have at this time no matters of Fact, 'tis
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:49990:284"/>not becauſe we have not thoſe that are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiderable to communicate unto you, but 'tis becauſe the Apologies for our Reformers, could not well be divided into two Letters. You may pleaſe to know only at this time, That the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and Violences do continue; but they diſpenſe them after a manner that we little underſtand, or can account for: In ſome places there is ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement and Relaxation; that which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood concerning it, is that the Convertors are in ſome diſtreſs what courſe to take, to carry on their great Work. The deſertion, and forſaking the Kingdom, which is greater than at firſt, makes them well ſee, that as yet they have advanced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and that they will keep no more of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in it, than thoſe which they ſhut up in Priſons, and ſend to the Gallies.</p>

               <salute>Dear Brethren in our Lord, Grace and Peace be given to you, from our<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </salute>

            <p>WE began in our laſt <hi>Letter,</hi> to hear the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Fathers of the fourth and fifth Ages, about the Euchariſt, and againſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation; at this time we ſhall hear them farther, even as far as is needful to convince the Papiſts of being Innovators. We have heard <hi>St. Chryſoſtome, St. Auſtine, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius, i. e.</hi> the chief Lights of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church, who tell us more boldly, and clearly than ever did <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> That the holy Symbols are Figures, Images, and Types of the Body and Bloud of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Nevertheleſs they did not deny that any change did happen in the Signs of Bread and Wine, nor do we deny it neither. But hear how they ſpake of this change: 'Tis true, when they ſpake thereof before the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or before the People, to whom they deſired to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:49990:285"/>give the greateſt and moſt venerable Idea's of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, there is nothing great and bold in the Figures of Rhetorick, and Similitudes which they did not borrow to expreſs this Change. From thence come thoſe great and magnificent Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> which are abuſed, that an Opinion might be aſcribed unto him, of which he never thought. This <hi>St. Chryſoſtome</hi> oftentimes ſpeaks, as if the Bread and Wine had been real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually changed into Fleſh and Bloud, and as if our Lips and Mouths were died and ſtained thereby: But by one ſingle paſſage of this Father, learn what he underſtood, and how he ought to be underſtood; when it was intended to ſpeak without Myſtery, and without Rhetorick, of the Change which happens by Conſecration, this Author, and others of the ſame Age, ſpeak of it as plainly as we ourſelves can do. <hi>St. Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays in his Epiſtle to <hi>Caeſarius, The Bread of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is called Bread, before it be ſanctified, but the Divine Grace having ſanctified it by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt, it bears no more the name of Bread, but is thought worthy to be called the Body of our Lord, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the nature of Bread remains.</hi> And <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>

He ſays that this eating is by Faith, and that the Wicked the Unbelieving and Unworthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants have no part therein. I conjure you, my Brethren, to conſider, whether any thing ſolid can be oppoſed to Teſtimonies ſo plain, and expreſs? What can the Harſhneſſes of <hi>St. Ambroſe,</hi> the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torications of <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> and the perplext Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocinations of <hi>St. Hillary,</hi> do againſt this? Can it hinder, that the Teſtimonies which we have heard, do not make a clear and convincing Depoſition againſt the Real Preſence? I enquire of you, Whether, if we muſt explain one by the other, it be juſt to explain thoſe which ſpeak ſimply, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without ambiguity, by thoſe who ſpeak like Orators, or in a myſtick Stile, that they may not be underſtood by <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Catechumens?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is it not juſt to explain an Author by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Are not five or ſix paſſages of <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> where he ſpeaks in plain terms, and diſcourſes of things as they are in themſelves, more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give the Reader a true underſtanding of the ſence and ſpirit of this Author? Where are the Chriſtian Orators with whom a man may not find Hereſies, if he will thus take them at advantage? And in the Books of Proteſtant Meditations, may not a man find a hundred paſſages which Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may abuſe after the ſame manner that they abuſe thoſe of <hi>St. Chryſoſtome,</hi> to eſtabliſh the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the Faith of the Euchariſt, in the ſence of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? I will ſtop here, and take it for granted, that the Faith was not changed in this Article, neither in the fourth nor fifth Ages, nor in the three that followed them.</p>
            <p>There happened neither any change in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament under both Kinds.
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:49990:287"/>And we boldly defie all your Converters to give us any proof, or any example of any Communion ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in thoſe Ages under the Species of Bread alone. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> who writ laſt on this ſubject, hath found no other example but that of <hi>St. Ambroſe,</hi> concerning whom the Author of his Life ſays, That he died as ſoon as he had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. A fine proof, that they did not alſo give him the Blood! As if it were not known that the whole Sacrament were not often expreſſed by the Fleſh, or the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt: And as if there were any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure more common, than that of ſignifying the whole by a part. I will not ſtay on this Article, to prove that no Change happened therein, in the fourth and fifth Ages, for 'tis a thing notorious, and not diſputed by our Adverſaries themſelves: All that they ſay is, That it was alſo permitted to communicate der one Kind; although the Cuſtom then was to communicate under both. But that they can-never prove. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> could not have made a Book which would have done him leſs Honour, than that which he hath made on this ſubject. It will never be believed that a man ſpeaks ſincerely, when he charges himſelf with Falſeneſs in a thing ſo publickly known as this is: 'Tis that for the ſpace of four hundred, or five hundred Years, the Cuſtom of Communicating under one Kind, was wholly unknown.</p>

                  <hi>An Article of Controverſie:</hi> An Anſwer to the fallacious Arguments drawn from the Viſibility of the Church.</head>
               <p>I Thought that I had finiſhed telling you, what was neceſſary you ſhould know, to diſ-intangle your ſelves from the Sophiſms which are drawn from the Unity of the Church, and from that Schiſm which breaks this Unity. We have employed Eleven Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles on that Subject in the Eleven Letters which are from the 9th to the 21th. We ſhall at this time open a ſecond Fountain of the Illuſions of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters, on the Subject of the Church, 'tis that of her Viſibility. 'Tis a long time ſince, that one of our moſt illuſtrious Confeſſors deſired of me ſome Eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereon, not ſo much for himſelf, as for many plain perſons which they had ruffled and perplext. But it was not poſſible for us to come at it ſooner, for if we had ſooner left off our Diſcourſe about its Unity and Schiſm, we ſhould have omitted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eſſential. Behold after what manner they form the Sophiſm drawn from the viſibility of the Church. <hi>'Tis neceſſary,</hi> they tell you, <hi>that the Church be always viſible; for ſhe is a City ſet upon a Hill and cannot be hid. How could it be, that the Pagans in all Ages ſhould be able to come over to the Church, if ſhe had been hidden? The Gate of Converſion had been ſhut upon them. Your hidden Believers are Chimera's. Beſides, 'tis neceſſary that the Miniſtry of the Church be always viſible. For you will never perſwade us, that the Miniſtry hath intirely failed; ſo that it was needful, (as your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith ſays) that God ſhould extraordinarily raiſe up Men to re-eſtabliſh it. Beſides, 'tis of the eſſence of the Church to be viſible; your Church cannot be the true
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:49990:288"/>Church, for it was not viſible</hi> 200 <hi>years ago; it was not viſible, ſay I, ſince it was not at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning this, in the firſt place, Don't you engage yourſelves to maintain, that the true Church is Inviſible, as if this point were neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your Cauſe, and our Church that was hidden before the Reformation. Your Converters quote many places of Scripture, (as Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has done in his Inſtructions, to Mademoiſelle <hi>de Duras</hi>) to prove to you, that the Church is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Society. Tell them, that is to no purpoſe; for we are at an Agreement therein with them. They may quote unto you many of our Doctors who have maintained, that the true Church was Inviſible. But know, my Brethren, that this is nothing but a Diſpute about Words, and that we are at an accord with them in the ſence of the thing. Our Divines mean, that the true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church are Inviſible, and not that the Society, in which the true Members of the Church are, is Inviſible. This is true, the true Members of the Church are Inviſible, for there are none but true Believers that are true Members of the Church: <hi>If you hear my voice, then are you my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples indeed:</hi> Now true predeſtinated Believers are viſible, as Men, but they are not viſible as Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; for no body ſees true Faith, 'tis in the heart, and the actions which appear without may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal: But the Society where theſe true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are, is viſible; for 'tis a Society of Men that ſerve God according to his Word and Laws, this is viſible. Underſtand this by the example of a Man, he hath a body and a ſoul, but the body in which this ſoul is, is viſible. True Believers are the ſoul of the Church, that is inviſible; the body of the Church is the external Society, and that is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Therefore as you may ſay of a Man, that
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:49990:289"/>he is viſible, and inviſible; inviſible with reſpect to his ſoul, viſible with reſpect to his body; ſo it may be ſaid concerning the Church, that ſhe is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible, inviſible with reſpect to her ſoul, which is true Faith, and true Believers; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with reſpect to the Society, in which this ſoul, <hi>i.e.</hi> theſe true Believers are encloſed. This is ſo clear and evident, that your Converters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſ-allow it. Behold already one point of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry made void: The Church is viſible, be it ſo, as a Man is viſible.</p>
               <p>After this, if they inquire of you, Is this viſible Church the Body of Jeſus Chriſt? Diſtinguiſh, and tell them, She is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, foraſmuch as ſhe contains in herſelf truly righteous perſons, and true Believers; but not becauſe ſhe encloſes wicked, hypocritical, and vitious perſons. For 'tis impoſſible that theſe perſons ſhould be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; otherwiſe Jeſus Chriſt would have rotten and ſtinking Members; otherwiſe Dogs, Swine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be in the Communion of Jeſus Chriſt. Now this is abſurd, for <hi>if any one have not the ſpirit of Christ, he is none of his, and there can be no communion between light and darkneſs, Christ and Belial.</hi> So that a Chriſtian which hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſimple Profeſſion, and neither Vertue nor Charity, a Lover of the Word, in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Society, is no true Member of Jeſus Chriſt, or his Church, be he Prieſt, Biſhop, or Guide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Make Reflections in this place on the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Doctrines of your Converters, of whom the moſt part will tell you, that to be a true Member of the Church, it ſuffices to make profeſſion of the Faith, and to adhere to lawful Paſtors. So that Prieſts that are Sorcerers and <hi>Sodomites,</hi> which you have oftentimes ſeen burnt at <hi>Paris,</hi> were the true Members of Jeſus Chriſt. This is capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:49990:289"/>a man tremble with horrour. They will ſay to you thereon, if they were not true Members of the Church, and of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they could not be the Guides thereof. Such a one is an evil Man, he is nevertheleſs a true Biſhop, he muſt therefore be a true Member of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Body. Anſwer to this, that which one of the Writers of <hi>Port Royal</hi> ſays ſomewhere, <hi>That oftentimes thoſe which Build</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and Guide it, are the Citizens of</hi> Babylon. Tell them, that to be a lawful Paſtor and Guide of the Church, to be able to adminiſter the Word, and Sacraments, with Authority, its enough to be a Member of the external and viſible Society, it is not neceſſary to be a Member of the true Church, to be in the hand of God an Inſtrument of his Work. A King may adminiſter Juſtice, and adminiſter it very well by a wicked man, who hath inwardly all ſorts of inclinations to Injuſtice. It will be ſaid a man cannot be the Head and Guide of a Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being a Member thereof, for the Head is one of its principal Members. It muſt be anſwered, That falſe Paſtors are true Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Society of the Church, and that they are alſo true Heads of that Society whereof they are true Members: but they are neither Heads nor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the principal and inviſible part of the Church, who are true Believers, and truly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons: They are not therefore true Heads but of that part whereof they are true Members, and that ſufficeth them for the external Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Word and Sacraments, for the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteous receive the Word and Sacraments in quality of the Members of the external Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>They will preſs you further, and tell you, You do confeſs the Church is viſible, becauſe ſhe hath
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:49990:290"/>a Body, which is an external Society. But is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways viſible? Although you ſhould anſwer, That it is not neceſſary that the Church be always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; they would not be able to convince you of the contrary by reaſon: For a man who is viſible by his body, may be ſometimes hidden, and by that means be inviſible. May not the external So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the Church, which is viſible, have been at ſometimes, and in ſome ſeaſons hidden, through the Perſecution of <hi>Pagans,</hi> or Hereticks? But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to them, that the Church hath been always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and will be to the end of the World. 'Tis true, that the Perſecutions under the <hi>Pagan</hi>-Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours were very great, but they never proceeded ſo far as utterly to deſtroy all Aſſemblies of the Church to that degree that there were no viſible Society of Chriſtians; the Chriſtians were well known under the Perſecutions, ſeeing they knew where to find them to make Martyrs of them; the Church was viſible in the midſt of the flames: She remained viſible in the Heretical Aſſemblies of the <hi>Arrians;</hi> for thoſe that held the Truth in thoſe Aſſemblies themſelves, were more numerous than thoſe that erred concerning it. If there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place where the Church were become inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it was in the <hi>Papiſm,</hi> for never was there a Church ſo corrupt and drowned in Superſtitions, as that: Nevertheleſs the Church continued there viſible, becauſe that Chriſtianity, and the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Chriſtian Religion did abide there: I do not ſay that they did remain there in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, but the contrary; nevertheleſs it ſufficeth, that they did continue there, 'tis neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you know, that where-ever Chriſtianity fore that you know, that where-ever Chriſtianity remains ſenſible and viſible, the Church remains viſible, for it is Chriſtianity that makes the Church. If a Sect become ſo corrupt that Chriſtianity is no
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:49990:290"/>longer viſible in it, ſuch are the <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> who have rejected the Foundations; the Church is no longer viſible among them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be as a dead man remains viſible, but it is alſo viſible that he is dead, without life, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoul: ſo in the Sects which have rejected the Foundations, the Church remains viſible, but it's alſo viſible that ſuch Churches are without life, without ſoul, without ſalvation. In the Sects which preſerve Chriſtianity, although they have added very many things thereunto, and even ſuch things as overturns the Foundations thereof, the Church doth not fail to remain viſible, becauſe Chriſtianity both is there, and is ſeen there. If therefore they do inquire of you, Where was your Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Calvin?</hi> Anſwer them, She was in the Chriſtian Societies that were in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> in thoſe which were in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in <hi>Africa,</hi> in thoſe which are, and were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church that was at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and the Churches of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and ſhe was even in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf. If they ask of you, Was the Church viſible in theſe Societies, or were the Members thereof hidden? Anſwer them, That the Church was viſible in theſe Societies, foraſmuch as Chriſtianity, and the Creed of the Apoſtles, in the true ſence thereof, explained in the firſt ſix General Councils, were viſibly preſerved there: Add you, that the true Members of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Church, were hidden, and not viſible, becauſe thoſe that ſincerely and truly adhered to this true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, contained in the Creeds of the Chriſtian Church, were not known by name: but that theſe Believers were hidden, was not at all peculiar to theſe corrupt Churches, becauſe of their Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; for the caſe is the ſame in the pureſt
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:49990:291"/>Churches, the true Members of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his body are hidden, becauſe we do not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know thoſe which adhere to the Chriſtian Faith in ſincerity, and with the heart. Behold a pure and native Explication of the true Viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, and of the Perpetuity of that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhop of Meaux,</hi> and your other Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will ſeem to you very well pleaſed in this, that you confeſs the Church is viſible, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways viſible. Behold they will ſay one point gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For if the Church be always viſible, <hi>'tis of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that there be a Succeſſion in the Miniſtry, a train of legitimate Paſtours: There will always be Teachers with whom Jeſus Chriſt will teach, and the true Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will never ceaſe in the Church.</hi> Theſe are Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> that great Converter's own words: That is to ſay, from the perpetual Viſibility of the Church, he draws theſe three concluſions:
<list>
                     <item>1. That pure and true Teaching hath never ceaſed in the Church.</item>
                     <item>2. That there will always be a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and train of legitimate Paſtours.</item>
                     <item>3. That Jeſus Chriſt will always teach with theſe Paſtours, <hi>i.e.</hi> they muſt be Infallible.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I intreat you, my Brethren, to attend to what I ſhall ſay concerning theſe three Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Gentlemen ſuppoſe that the Church cannot be perpetual, and perpetually viſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being pure, and without continuing pure, and exempt from corruption in the Faith. <hi>The Church is always viſible, therefore pure preaching must always remain there.</hi> Can a man argue more pitifully? 'tis juſt as if I ſhould ſay, Whilſt Man hath a Soul in his Body, he muſt be always ſound, and hail, as if Health were inſeparable from Life. Where have they found that Purity, with reſpect to Faith, is in
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:49990:291"/>ſeparable from Viſibility? And becauſe the Church is always viſible, doth it follow, that ſhe is always ſound? if the nature of the Church conſiſted in an indiviſible point. and in that certain ſtate of purity of Faith in which there was no kind of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; tis true, the Church would periſh, ceaſe to be, and by conſequence to be viſible, as ſoon as the Chriſtian Doctrine ſhould come to be mingled with any Doctrine that is ſtrange and forreign thereto: And indeed 'tis the ſuppoſition of your Converters. But 'tis the moſt fooliſh Dream that ever entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind of Man, the moſt contrary to the Word of God and Experience, that ever was aſſerted. The moſt contrary to the Scripture: for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſays, That <hi>there ſhall be in the Church thorns and thiſtles mingled with the good grain. Wolves will creep in and deſtroy the flock. That there muſt be hereſies. That men will build upon the foundation wood, bay, ſtubble. And that even the Son of perdition will ſit in the Church and Temple of God.</hi> The moſt contrary to Experience, for for the ſpace of 1300 or 1400 years, which way ſoever we caſt our Eyes, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chriſtianity every-where ſpoiled by falſe and ſtrange Doctrines. Lay down this therefore as a thing indiſputable, that the Church muſt be always viſible, that ſhe muſt always ſubſiſt, but not that ſhe muſt always ſubſiſt pure and underfiled. The Church began to be corrupt conſiderably in the fourth Age; and in two Ages the Corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch, that Antichriſtianity, which is the higheſt degree of the corruption of Chriſtianity, proceeded and came out from thence.</p>
               <p>But in the midſt of this great Corruption, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity nevertheleſs preſerved it ſelf, it remained very viſible, and by conſequence the Church alſo continued viſible: for yet once more the Church remains every-where, where Chriſtianity remains;
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:49990:292"/>and the Church remains viſible every-where, where Chriſtianity remains yiſible. Remember-therefore that Popery is a very high and extream Corruption of Chriſtianity, but 'tis not the Annihilation of it: for we muſt well diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Annihilation</hi> and <hi>extream Corruption</hi> of it. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had rejected the Foundations, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> have done, ſhe would have been no more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible than as a dead Body is viſible: But becauſe ſhe hath only added an infinite number of falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſuperſtitious and idolatrous, whilſt ſhe hath retained Fundamentals, ſhe hath only <hi>corrupted</hi> Chriſtianity. But Chriſtianity in the midſt of theſe Corruptions, hath not failed to remain viſible, to thoſe which ſearch, after it with diligence and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Imagine you an Egg not broken, which ſwims in dirty and ſtinking water; 'tis the perfect Emblem of the Roman Religion. The Egg whole and not broken, is the Chriſtian Creed preſerved in its integrity in the ſenſe of the Church. The filthy and ſtinking Water where this Egg ſwims, is the heap of Superſtitions, Errors, and Idolatries of Popery. The Egg remains viſible in the midſt of this filthy Water, and even the oppoſition of the blackneſs of the Mire to the whiteneſs of the Egg, make it in ſome ſort more viſible. The Body of Chriſtianity is alſo viſible in the heap of Popiſh Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and to him that will give attention thereunto, it may be ſaid, that the true Chriſtianity which doth continue in the Roman Religion, ſerves to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and make the uglineſs of Popery more horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Mud and the ſtinking Water which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth this Egg, is viſible as well as the Egg. 'Tis the light of the day which manifeſts the one and the other. The Corruption introduced by Popery in the Roman Religion, is viſible as well as Chriſtianity.
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:49990:292"/>'Tis the light of the day, <hi>i.e.</hi> the light of the Word of God which manifeſts both: for the Word of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts Chriſtianity in the Romiſh Religion, by the fair conformity of the three Creeds; that of the Apoſtles, that of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> with the Revelation. This ſame word manifeſts Antichriſtianity, the Mud and the Dirt of Popery, by the frightful diſſimilitude and unlikeneſs which is between Popery and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. It ſeems to me that he muſt be very bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, not to perceive all this, and not to ſee that the Church may always endure, and always be even vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, although it be not neceſſary that ſhe always continue in perfect Purity.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs, there is in the firſt conſequence of your Converters ſome truth, which ſerves for a foundation to that groſs Illuſion which they would put upon you. They ſay, <hi>The Church is always viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore pure Preaching muſt always continue there.</hi> If the meaning be, 'tis of neceſſity that ſomething of pure Preaching do always remain there, yea, and that the eſſential parts of true Preaching remain there, 'tis true: for if the Fundamentals and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of Chriſtianity were not there, there were no Church there. Moreover 'tis true, that in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in the Oriental Communions, the <hi>Cophtis,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and the <hi>Armenians,</hi> pure Preaching doth continue, as to the Fundamentals of the Creed, which make the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſtianity. But it doth not follow at all, that Preaching muſt neceſſarily remain there wholly pure and incorrupt.</p>
               <p>Not being able to proceed at this time to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the two laſt conſequences, which your Converters draw from the perpetual viſibility of the Church; I will conclude by anſwering a Queſtion which they put unto you, and which it may be you put unto your ſelves: Can a man be ſaved in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:49990:293"/>which you compare to a great Baſon full of Dirt and ſtinking Water, in which ſwims a good Egg, clean, and in its integrity? This reſpects thoſe who deſire to ſave themſelves in the Roman Church, becauſe ſhe retains the Egg, the Creed of Chriſtians, in its perfection. You may well think that we ſhould have a great many things to ſay to them, if we would ſay all, and were willing to repeat what we have ſaid concerning it in our Seventeenth Letter. But in this place I ſhall only anſwer to them, That it does not follow, that a man may be ſaved in a Communion which retains the Egg of Chriſtianity, whilſt he ſwims in the Dung which compaſſes the Egg, and nouriſhes himſelf with it; a man plunged in a hideous Mire, which receives the ſtinking dirt by his mouth, becauſe he ſees ſome Fruits uſeful for nouriſhment ſwim in this ſlime, can he live thereby. Yea, ſuppoſe that he eats of theſe Fruits, if at the ſame time he eats this corrupt ſlime, will he die e're a whit the leſs? If this man finds an Art to ſeparate the ſlime from the nouriſhments which ſwim there, ſo that he take nothing but the nouriſhments, I do confeſs that he may live. In like manner, if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can live in the Roman Communion, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the good from the bad, he may be ſaved. But this is that which we do maintain to be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at this time, for the adult. Theſe corrupt and dirty Communions are therefore ſaving to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who partake in Chriſtianity, without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in the corruption thereof. For example: We ought not to call in doubt the ſalvation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which die in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for they have eaten the Egg, God hath communicated to them his Grace by their Baptiſm, or their Birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were born within the borders of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. As for the adult, if they can eat the Egg, and not ſwallow the Dung, if they can partake in
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:49990:293"/>pure Chriſtianity, without taking part in its corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may, I do confeſs, live and be ſaved in that Communion. But this is the difficulty, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impoſſibility, Who is he that can live in the Roman Communion, without aſſiſting at the falſe Sacrifice of the Maſs, without worſhipping Bread, conſenting to the Invocation of Saints, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images? This is enough at preſent to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe our unhappy Indifferents, who would very falſly perſwade themſelves, that they may be ſaved in the Eſtate wherein they are.</p>

                  <body>
                     <p>FOR News we give you this day a Letter, which will teach you the Conſtancy of ſome of our Confeſſors of <hi>Dauphine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have yet in <hi>Dauphine</hi> ſome Illuſtrious Perſons, which maintain the Cauſe of God in the midst of their Enemies. There is Mr. <hi>de l' Alo</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luche,</hi> a Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who being at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>1685.</hi> and refuſing to change his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was baniſhed with Madam his Wife, into a paltry Village, where he could not get ſo much as one perſon that would ſerve him for his money. After that they had been kept there ſome months, Madam <hi>de l'Alo</hi> fell into very great indiſpoſitions; they ſent her into <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine,</hi> and removed Mr. <hi>de l'Alo</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Trompette,</hi> where he was confined within four Walls, without ſuffering him to have any other ſociety than that of a Monk, who went every day to torment him after a thouſand ways; and when he could gain nothing, he left him, and ſaid to him; He muſt make himſelf ready to be tranſported to the <hi>Pyrenees.</hi> This is it that he wrote to one of the Gentlemen his Brethren about ſix months ſince, teſtifying to him, That he reckoned all that he had
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:49990:294"/>ſuffered as nothing, or any thing that he could ſuffer; and that he would never abandon the Faith which he had profeſſed to that moment.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur the Marquiſs of <hi>Pierre,</hi> alſo a Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> is one of our most Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Confeſſors; he was extreamly famous in his Religion as well as in his Employ: ſo that his Zeal went an equal pace with his Knowledge, and both the one and the other hath gained him great Reputation among his Brethren. The Court, which fear'd he might confirm them, if he were ſuffered among them, commanded him to render himſelf at <hi>Paris,</hi> by a Letter under the Privy Sign, which they ſent him a little before the Dragoons came into that Province. This Lord, who was not conſcious to himſelf of any fault, and who had long before prepared himſelf to ſuffer not only the loſs of his Office, and of all his Goods, and to beg from door to door with Madam his Wife, and the Gentlemen his Sons, but alſo to loſe his Head upon a Scaffold, yea to be burnt alive, rather than betray his Saviour, yea to be burnt alive, rather than betray his Saviour, as he ſaid in theſe very words to a Paſtor of his Province. (It was to him who gave us this Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence about three weeks before he received that Letter under the Privy-Sign.) He was in that generous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, when he went for <hi>Paris</hi> in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with one of the Gentlemen his Sons. Arriving at <hi>Paris,</hi> he addreſſed himſelf to the Miniſters of State, to know the cauſe of that Summons that they had given him. But they ſaid nothing to him. He abode at <hi>Paris</hi> about ſix months, without having any thing ſaid to him, at the last they propoſed to him to change his Religion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it. They took from him Monſieur his Son, who was all his comfort, and ſaid to him, that the King would have him brought up in the Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: This was the most ſmart ſtroak of all the rest. He reſolved to depart from <hi>Paris,</hi> he went thence with Mr. <hi>de Vic,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen. They were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted at <hi>Laudrecy;</hi> the other for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ear, changed their
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:49990:294"/>Religion. Mr. <hi>de la Pierre</hi> would not do ſo. There was an Order from the King to convey him to the Citadel of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and thither he was conveyed. A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of the Parliament of <hi>Tournay</hi> had a Commiſſion to examine him, and to make his Proceſs. He anſwered him always with a perfect freedom of mind, and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable firmneſs. The Commiſſary told him, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Gallies, for attempting to go out of the Realm without leave, and that he could not hinder his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He anſwered him, That he was ready not only to go to the Gallies, but alſo to death. We have not yet learnt that he hath been condemned. He continues a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, but always ſtout and firm.</p>
                     <p>We muſt put in the Rank of our Illuſtrious Confeſſors, Madam <hi>de Bardonnanche,</hi> Wife of a Counſellor in the Parliament of that Name, and Vicounteſs of <hi>Trienes</hi> in <hi>Dauphine.</hi> This Lady who was formerly diſtinguiſhed by her great Knowledge, (above all in Piety) and by her Eminent Vertues as well as by her great Quality, is now diſtinguiſhed after another manner in theſe laſt Tryals.</p>
                     <p>About four years ſince ſhe ſaw that revolt of her Husband, which ſhe teſtified by a great Grief: Since that they took from her one of her Daughters, to bring her up in the new Religion of her Father: ſhe was more wounded for this, then for the loſs of her Husband: In fine, ſhe ſaw the laſt and great Deſolation of our Churches: But all this hath not the leaſt moved her, nor frighted her in any ſort. When that the <hi>Dragoons</hi> had put all into Diſpair in her Country, and the reſt of the Province, ſhe boldly exhorted every one to be firm, and as a Paſtor of her acquaintance, (it was he who wrote her Story) bad her to think of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the Kingdom, becauſe ſhe ſaw her ſelf unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable there; (the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was not revoked) She wrote to him that ſhe muſt not be one of thoſe Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, who ſeeing the Woolf coming fled away; and he alledging his own Exemple, ſhe ſaid that ſhe would not depart out of the State, at leaſt till the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:49990:295"/>her, and that ſhe hoped that God would give her the Grace to ſurmount all, and abide firm. After that they had ſubverted all the Churches of that Country. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant <hi>Le Bret, M. le Camus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and at this time Cardinal, the Marqueſs <hi>de la Trouſſe,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Troops in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> went to ſee her in her Caſtle <hi>du Monotier</hi> of <hi>Clermont;</hi> they diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, they made Requeſts to her, with Promiſe, and Threats; ſhe defended her ſelf vigorouſly againſt all their Attaques, and in the end they left her. Some days after they ſent to take her away, by the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> to confine her in a Covent at <hi>Grenoble:</hi> Seeing ſhe was always the ſame, they threatned to ſend her to <hi>Valence,</hi> and to put her into the hands of <hi>Rapine;</hi> ſhe anſwered that ſhe would go whether they pleaſed, even to the Fire, but not to the Maſs. In the end they? executed one part of the ſaid threatning upon her, ſending her to <hi>Valence,</hi> but not to the Butchery of <hi>Rapine,</hi> they put her into a Convent of the Religious, with a prohibition to permit her to ſpeak to any of them, which they call the New Converts. This Lady ſuffered her Removal, and her Impriſonment in that Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with ſo much patience, and ſweetneſs, that 'tis ſaid ſhe abated the rage, and fury of her Perſecutors. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Religious with ſo much Decency, and ſpake to them ſuch handſome things of our Religion, that ſhe won at firſt their Heart, and almoſt perſwaded them to be Chriſtians. The Intendant, and the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> underſtanding that this Priſoner triumpht over her Goalers, gave order that ſhe ſhould be fetcht from the Convent where ſhe was put, and be removed into another, which was done, and Madam <hi>de Bardonnanche</hi> behaved her ſelf there, after the ſame manner, there ſhe made alſo the ſame Progreſs upon the Spirits of her new Hoſteſſes. They took her alſo from that Convent, and confined her in another in the ſame place, with a Command not to ſpeak to her, nor to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uffer her to ſpeak to any body. Since we have l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>arnt by one of our Brethren well worthy of Credit, who
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:49990:295"/>came lately from that Province, that there hath been a new Order to remove her into another Convent at <hi>Vif,</hi> a Town which is not above two leagues from <hi>Grenoble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I could increaſe theſe Relations with divers Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with others like them, as that of Monſieur <hi>de Sainct Croſs,</hi> the Son of a Counſellor of the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> who hath been at <hi>Pierre Size</hi> theſe five Months, becauſe he would not change; that alſo if the three Paſtors of <hi>Orange,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chion,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gondran,</hi> Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Onet</hi> Paſtor of <hi>Courteſon</hi> near <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> who have long been kept in the Priſons of <hi>Valence,</hi> and who are now at <hi>Pierre Size,</hi> though they be not able to reproach them for having done any thing againſt the King, in whoſe State they lived not, and who teſtifie an admirable Conſtancy, although very many did yield before their Eyes. That of Monſieur <hi>de Beauregard,</hi> Burgeſs of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> near to St. <hi>Marcelin,</hi> in the ſame Province, who after he had ſeen all his Goods devoured, which were very great, hath ſuffered the moſt cruel torments in his Body, until they had hardened, and ſhrunk up the Nerves of his Legs, by the violence of the approaching Fire, and had laid him upon a pile of wood, ſaying unto him, that he ſhould be burnt alive, in one word, whom they had tormented till he loſt his Reaſon, who being at length ſet at liberty, is happily retired out of the Kingdom into <hi>Switzerland.</hi> That of Monſieur <hi>Delis,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Trienes</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who choſe rather to ſuffer Martyrdom, and hath actually ſuffered it in the Month of <hi>January 1686,</hi> at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> rather than change: But of this enough for this time.</p>

            <p>IN the two preceding Letters you have ſeen what the Ancients of the fourth and fifth Ages did think on the ſubject of the Euchariſt. You have ſeen that they acknowledge nothing there but Signs, and Images of the Body, and Bloud of our Lord, and that they apprehended no other change there, but a change of Grace, which made no alteration in the nature of the ſpecies of Bread and Wine. So the Faith of the Church was not changed therein; there remains the Adoration, concerning which it is alſo certain, that there hapned no change in the Ages where we are. They did not Adore the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the three firſt Ages, nor did they Adore it in theſe. Suffer not your ſelves to be ſurpriſed, my Brethren, by five or ſix words which they quote to you from <hi>St. Ambroſe,</hi> or <hi>St. Auſtine,</hi> who ſay, <hi>That
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:49990:297"/>'tis neceſſary that we Adore the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt in the Myſteries, and that we muſt not eat the Fleſh of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt when we have not Adored it.</hi> We muſt not ſearch the practice of an Age in rambling, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expreſſions, as theſe are. 'Tis in Hiſtory, and in matters of Fact. There is not a perſon among us, that does not acknowledge, that we muſt Adore Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the participation of the Myſteries; that is not the thing whereof we diſpute. It muſt be known whether they bowed the Knew before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, whether they lifted it up before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that it might be Adored; now we do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this was not done. And I do not know whether your Converters have the boldneſs to ſay the contrary; at leaſt they have not Ability enough to prove it. They dazle your Eyes with a paſſage of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who ſays, ſpeaking of the Symbols of Bread and Wine,<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dialog.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>That we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the underſtanding that they are what they were made, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and Adore them as being that which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</hi> But obſerve, 'tis the ſame place where this Author tells us, that which we have mentioned unto you before; <hi>That the Myſtical Symbols do not looſe their proper Nature after their Conſecration, but that they remain in their firſt Subſtance, their firſt Figure, and their firſt Form, they are viſible, and palpable as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> He adds then immediately after the words, which are abuſed to prove the Adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. 'Tis the ſame Author which hath told us after a very expreſs manner, that God in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>doth not change Nature, but add Grace to Nature.</hi> After this 'tis unavoidable, that he muſt have loſt his Wits to ſay, that we muſt Adore Bread, and Wine, which remain ſuch, and which have received no change in their <hi>Subſtance.</hi> Who doth not ſee then that the word Adore is here taken for Venerate, and
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:49990:298"/>in the ſame ſenſe that we call the Myſteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Adorable, and that we ſay we muſt Adore the Conduct of Providence. In the ſenſe that <hi>St. Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Damietta</hi> calls the Goſpels<note n="(b)" place="margin">

               </note> Adorable by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils themſelves: And that the Table was called the Adorable Altar by the ſame Councils. To conclude, <hi>Theodoret</hi> muſt be underſtood as he deſires to be underſtood, for 'tis he that ſays in the following Dialogue, <hi>If the Body of Jeſus Chriſt ſeems to you vile, and of little value, Why do you eſteem its Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure whereof is Adorable, and worthy of Honour, can it ſelf be abject and contemptible?</hi> Behold again, the Euchariſt which is nothing but a Figure, and a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure oppoſite to the Body, and which by conſequence is not the Body. But 'tis nevertheleſs <hi>an Adorable Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi> Judge whether <hi>Theodoret</hi> were ſo pitiful a Chriſtian to believe we muſt Adore a Figure.</p>
            <p>If we would find the practice of the Church in paſſages like theſe, it were better to ſearch it in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of <hi>St. Auſtin,</hi> where this Father ſays for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Serm. <hi>2.</hi> de diverſis.</note> 
               <hi>That that which he A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores is not a thing towards which he could ſtretch out his Finger, and ſay, Behold the God which I Adore.</hi> Or rather in the place where he ſays,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Serm. <hi>74.</hi> de diverſie.</note> 
               <hi>Whilſt we are in the Body we are abſent from the Lord, and if any one doubt or deny it, and ſay to us, Where is your God? we cannot ſhew him. Jeſus Christ is always with his Father, as to the preſence of his Glory, and Divinity; as to his Corporeal Preſence he is now above the Heavens, at the right Hand of the Father, but he is in all Chriſtians by a preſence of Faith.</hi> It muſt be profeſſed, that <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> is an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Author for theſe Tranſubſtantiators, we can't
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:49990:298"/>make him open his mouth, but Thunders proceed from it againſt the now reigning Hereſie and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. It appears here, that he neither adored the Sacrament, nor lookt upon it as his God; for he could not have found any difficulty in anſwering that queſtion, Where is your God? It appear alſo, that he had comprehended this admirable corporeal preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament: for he reſerves all the corporeal preſence of Chriſt to the Heavens, and leaves nothing to Earth, but a preſence of Faith. This poor man underſtood his Religion very ill.</p>
            <p>We ought alſo to give attention to what St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſays, ſpeaking of ſacred Signs, that there are ſome of them ſubſiſt after the action, as the Braſen Serpent,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. cap. <hi>10.</hi>

But becauſe theſe things being made by men, are known to men, they may well receive honour, and give occaſion for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as things miraculous.</hi> What a poor man was this St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and how many overſights in four lines!
<list>
                  <item>1. He would not have us worſhip the Bread, we ought only to give it ſome reſpect, as to a religious thing.</item>
                  <item>2. He would not have us admire the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as a thing miraculous. Of what did he think, thus to ſpeak of the greateſt Miracle that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſince the creation of the World? Is it not a thing miraculous, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt with all his ſubſtance ſhould ſubſiſt in a point, ſhould be ſtript of all its Accidents, and be in an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of places at once? I cannot tell then any more what will be called a thing miraculous.</item>

            <p>To conclude, to theſe three or four words of St. <hi>Auſtin, That none eats the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, before he hath adored it,</hi> we ought to oppoſe what he ſays in the third Book concerning the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note n="†" place="margin">De Doctr.

               </note> 
               <hi>That every one knows the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm, and the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body and Bloud of our Lord, that 'tis well known whereunto they have reſpect, and that they are reverenced not by a ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> i.e. <hi>after a carnal manner, but by a ſpiritual li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> Here St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> deſires that we give to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm the ſame honour, as to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. We muſt confeſs, if St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did adore the Sacrament, we ought to make no ſcruple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; we owe him this complaiſance, for that he hath ſpoken as abſolutely concerning it, as our ſelves. For during the ſpace of two hundred years paſt, there hath not been either <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinist,</hi> which hath ſpoken more boldly or more clearly againſt the Real Preſence and Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If this ſuffice not to know what kind of Worſhip was given to the Euchariſt, we muſt learn it from the Hiſtory of matters of fact. We learn from Mr. <hi>de Valois,</hi> in his Notes upon <hi>Euſebius,</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi> Hiſt. Eccleſ.</note> 
               <hi>That the Believers which were to communicate, approached the Altar, and there received the Body of Jeſus Chriſt from the hand of the Prieſt, ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and not on their knees, as at this day.</hi> The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has paſſed for a good Roman Catholick, he is learned, and he is a Modern Writer: ſo that he wants nothing to give him an authority in the hearts of the New Converts, who refer themſelves much more
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:49990:299"/>concerning Religion, to what their new Authors ſpeak of it, then to what is ſaid thereof by thoſe that are more ancient. And indeed how could they communicate otherwiſe than ſtanding, ſince they prayed ſtanding on the Lords day, and the fifty days which are from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Whitſontide,</hi> in memory of the Reſurrection? When they were ready to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, they put out the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> i.e. well nigh half the Chriſtians, is it probable that they would deprive them of the comfort of adoring their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if it had been then the cuſtom of adoring him in the Sacrament? In thoſe Ages they did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Infants, and how could they exact Adoration before the Manducation, ſince Infants are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of performing an Act of Adoration?</p>
            <p>I may alſo reckon amongſt thoſe Articles, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which there was no change in the fourth and fifth Ages, that of Purgatory. For the opinion of a ſeparate place, where Souls were to be kept till the day of Judgment, without ſeeing the face of God, but without ſuffering any thing there, was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the greateſt men of thoſe Ages; of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> St. <hi>Hillary,</hi> St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der names ſo great, it may not be doubted, but it was the prevailing Opinion. 'Twas the third place of the Chriſtians that then were, but as yet there were but few footſteps of a fourth place ſeen. 'Tis true, that in theſe Ages a man may ſhew you ſome paſſages of <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> and even ſome of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> which ſpeak of a Purgation of Sins, which ought to be made after death by the means of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Fire. But this is not the Purgatory of Popery, 'tis that of <hi>Origen:</hi> according to whom, we have ſeen that all intelligent Creatures, without excepting Devils, and wicked men, who die impenitently, ought to be recovered and re-eſtabliſhed. <hi>Originiſm</hi> did not die with <hi>Origen,</hi> and many famous Fathers
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:49990:300"/>of the fourth Age were infatuated with it. Thoſe which know the Hiſtory of the Quarrels between St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> are not ignorant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I think indeed that few men did then dare to maintain the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> crude as he left it, touching the future ſalvation of the Devils and the damned. But many endeavoured to ſoften and ſmooth it, and ſaid at leaſt, Chriſtians who died in the profeſſion of the Faith, but without Holineſs and Repentance, would one day be recovered. 'Tis without doubt, that this Opinion mitigated and ſoftned, was one ſtep which made the Church fall into the Error of Purgatory: For after they had reſtrained thoſe that were to be purged by a Penal Fire, to ſuch as died without Holineſs and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by little and little they reſtrained them to ſuch, who dying without Repentance, had not ſatisfied the Canonical Penances of the Church.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was not of the opinion of thoſe who believed that ill Chriſtians dying without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, were to be purged by fire; nevertheleſs he thought it probable,<note n="*" place="margin">Enchir. cap. <hi>67</hi>
               </note> that thoſe who had too much affection for temporal good things during the ſpace of this Life, after death would be afflicted with grief for the loſs of them, and that this would ſerve them for a Caſtigation. Nevertheleſs he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this but as a doubtful conjecture. <hi>It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,</hi> ſays he,<note n="†" place="margin">Enchir. cap. <hi>69.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but that ſomething of like nature happens after death, and it may be diſputed, whether it be ſo, that ſome Believers ſhall be ſaved ſooner or later by a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire, according as they have more or leſs loved theſe periſhing good things.</hi> By this Purgative Fire, or <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> he underſtands nothing but the grief of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of theſe periſhing things. And this is
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:49990:300"/>that which he means in the ſame Book<note n="‖" place="margin">Enchir. cap. <hi>109.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That during the whole ſpace of time between a mans death, and the last Reſurrection, Souls are in hidden Receptacles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they are worthy of repoſe or miſery, with reſpect to what they have been during this life.</hi> A man cannot deny, but this is <hi>Purgatory</hi> in its birth, but it was not as yet believed and received of all the Church, nor hath it been received nor perfected any where but in the Latin Church.</p>
            <p>Behold that which I have to tell you concerning the changes happening in Doctrines and Worſhip. I will not paſs on to the following Ages, becauſe 'tis not my deſign to give you a compleat Hiſtory of all the changes which have happened in the Church for 1700 years. I only deſire to confound the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and ſuch-like, which dare to affirm that Chriſtianity in their hands is in the ſame eſtate in which it was when it paſſed from the Apoſtles to their immediate Succeſſors; and that time hath changed nothing that is eſſential in the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church; that inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible changes, whereof ſome men ſpeak to you, are but Dreams. Behold, ſay I, enough to ruine theſe raſh affirmations of your Converters: for from this ſhort Hiſtory, which I have given you, of the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Church, for the ſpace of 500 years, it appears,
<list>
                  <item>1. That during theſe five Ages there has happened very conſiderable and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential alterations, ſince that in this time men have overwhelmed Religion by an infinite multitude of vain Ceremonies, which have degenerated into Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; that they have introduced the criminal Worſhip of Creatures; that they have eſtabliſhed the diſtinctions of Powers and Tribunals, which at laſt have deſtroyed the true Authority of the Holy Scripture.</item>
                  <item>2. It appears by that which we have
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:49990:301"/>ſhewn to you, that far greater changes have yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince the fifth Age, than had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for ſeeing that in theſe Ages men knew nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tranſubſtantiation, nor the Real Preſence, nor the Adoration of the Sacrament, nor the Worſhip of Images, nor Purgatory, nor the Sacrifice of the Maſs, nor the Communion under One Kind, nor the Soveraign Authority of the Pope; all theſe points being at this day fundamental Articles of Popery, 'tis unavoidable that ſince that time there have happened great changes and alterations.</item>
               </list> And to prove the truth thereof againſt the illuſion of the impoſſibility of inſenſible changes, you have nothing to do, my Brethren, but to ſerve your ſelves of the Proofs which we have put into your hands, and ſay, In the fifth Age the Real Preſence was not believed, 'tis believed at this day; they did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Sacrament, they adore it now; they did not worſhip Images, they do worſhip them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: therefore a change is happened.</p>
            <p>To convince your Converters of the poſſibility of changes in things that are eſſential, ſerve your ſelves only of the Example of Maſſes, without Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. They will not dare to deny, that this is not a thing wholly unknown to all Antiquity. And I dare tell you, that if they had ſeen a Prieſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate alone in the Myſteries, they would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Spirit of Reprobation were fallen upon the whole Aſſembly.</p>

<pb n="581" facs="tcp:49990:301"/>ſhould be changed into a Spectacle, where all the Devotion of the People conſiſts in ſeeing without eating, and without underſtanding. Beſides, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on depends the queſtion concerning the Sacrifice of the Maſs: for if it be a true Sacrifice, they have ſome reaſon to ſay, that 'tis not always neceſſary that the Faithful eat thereof. But that the Ancients did never permit any to aſſiſt at the Myſteries, without participation in them, is an evident proof that they did not then look on them as a Sacrifice, the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy whereof depends upon the Oblation, but as a Sacrament, the whole efficacy whereof depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reception.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN our preceding Letter, we have explained how the Church is Viſible, and always Viſible; and we have refuted one of the Conſequences which the Converters draw from thence: behold another of them, unto which it behoves us to anſwer: <hi>The Church,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is always Viſible, therefore 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that ſhe ſhould always have had a Succeſſion of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtours.</hi> This is deſigned to make you confeſs,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the Paſtours of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are lawful Paſtours, and always have been ſo.</item>
                     <item>2. And by conſequence, that we are ſeparated from lawful Paſtours, and a lawful Miniſtery.</item>
                  </list> To this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That from this, that the Church is always Viſible, it doth indeed follow, that there hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been true Preaching in ſome points, <hi>i. e.</hi> in fundamental Articles; in like manner, that it doth
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:49990:302"/>follow, that there hath been always true Paſtors in ſome things, and in ſome reſpect: but it doth not follow, that the Miniſtery which is legitimate in ſome things, is ſo in every thing; for you muſt know, that the Miniſtery depends only upon the Doctrine. If the Chriſtian Doctrine be wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and annihilated in a Society, the Miniſtery is null'd, nor is there any thing lawful there. If the Doctrine be pure, and Chriſtian in all its parts, the Miniſtery is intirely legitimate in all reſpects. To conclude, if the Doctrine be partly Chriſtian, and partly Antichriſtian, the Miniſtery is partly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and partly unlawful. This is the condition of the Miniſtery of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> in that Church there is Chriſtianity and Antichriſtianity, Chriſtianity in the <hi>Creeds,</hi> and Antichriſtianity in the ſuperſtitions and Idolatrous Additions. The Paſtors of that Church receive Commiſſion to preach both Chriſtianity and Antichriſtianity; the Miniſtery is legitimate in that they receive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach Chriſtianity, their Miniſtery, and their Miſſion is wholly illegitimate in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Commiſſion to preach Antichriſtianity: 'Tis null, for <hi>we can do nothing againſt the Truth.</hi> If you well underſtand this, you will eaſily anſwer the queſtion propoſed unto you, <hi>Why do you Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from a true and lawful Miniſtery?</hi> Anſwer, we do not ſeparate from the Miniſtery of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in that which it teaches of Truth, in the preaching of the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> nor in that which it hath of Lawful. In this reſpect we are united, for we are in the ſame Doctrine, and by conſequence in the ſame Miniſtery: We are not ſeparate from the Miniſtery of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> but with reſpect to the Commiſſion ſhe gives her Paſtors to make the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and teach Idolatry; now this part of her Miniſtery is null, vain, criminal and illegitimate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:49990:302"/>
The third falſe conſequence which your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters draw from the perpetual Viſibility of the Church is, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will always teach with theſe viſible Paſtors.</hi> If Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and thoſe like him, underſtand thereby, that Jeſus Chriſt ought to guide them by a Spirit of Infallibility, the ſuppoſition is falſe, and there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of adding any thing to make the Falſeneſs thereof appear: For I have proved that perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Viſibility doth not ſignifie, that the Church by remaining always viſible, muſt neceſſarily be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pure and infallible. This is true in its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors as well as in its other Members; for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have no priviledge of being infallible, any more than the other parts of the Church. If you deſire that I ſhould add ſomething thereon, it ſhall be only this: 'Tis that the Church is as a Man, who after he hath been young and ſound, becomes old and diſeaſed: This Man is viſible, with his gray Hairs and his rotten Teeth and Wrinkles, juſt as he was when he had his complexion freſh, his colour lively, &amp; the air of his countenance brisk &amp; vigorous. In like manner the Church hath been young, ſound and pure, in the Ages next to the Apoſtles, by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little ſhe is grown old, and at laſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deformed through corruption: but ſhe is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in this old age an corruption, as ſhe was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in her youth and purity: ſo that neither her youth nor her old age, neither purity nor corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption ſignifie any thing to Viſibility. The caſe is the ſame concerning the Perpetuity of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: the Miniſtery is perpetual, therefore 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. Deny that conſequence without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for 'tis falſe; but ſome will ſay, Does not the Lord teach with thoſe Paſtors which follow one another in the order of Ages? Anſwer Ye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Paſtors teach the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:49990:303"/>to the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt teaches with them, and they with Jeſus Chriſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teach beyond the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and ſuperſtitious Doctrines, they teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt. My Brethren, that which I have ſaid unto you in this, and the preceding Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is ſufficient to make you underſtand what is the perpetual Viſibility of the Church. Read it, and read it again, until you underſtand, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it very well, and you will eaſily anſwer the two Sophiſms which your Adverſaries put upon you.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That if the Church hath not been always viſible; the <hi>Pagans</hi> for a thouſand, or twelve hundred years before <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation, had no door open to their converſion: For how ſhould they be converted, and how ſhould they find the Church, if ſhe were inviſible? Now 'tis a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy contrary to all reaſon and probability, that God for the ſpace of ſo many Ages, ſhould hold the door of the Church cloſe and hidden: Beſides, this is contrary to Hiſtory and Experience, which learns us, that the moſt part of the Northern Nations, <hi>Sweden, Denmark, Poland,</hi> and many Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> did not receive the Chriſtian Faith till ſince the eighth Age, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſince the time that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity was mixed with the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: For the <hi>Roman Church</hi> began according to us to be Antichriſtian before the ſixth Age. This is a difficulty which they propoſe to you; to which you ought to anſwer, That according to what we have told you, we do not teach that the Church became invſible by the Antichriſtianity which is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there; ſhe is corrupt but ſhe continues viſible. Chriſtianity hath not failed to continue its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in <hi>Popery,</hi> therefore the Church remains intirely there. I have told you that Chriſtianity and the Church are the ſame thing. This Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:49990:303"/>continuing viſible in the Books of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> and in the three <hi>Creeds,</hi> which the providence of God hath preſerved in <hi>Popery,</hi> the door of converſion hath been always open to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations: for Jeſus Chriſt crucified, and his true Myſteries, have not failed to preſerve their force and efficacy, in deſpight to all the Darkneſs which the baſtard Myſteries of Antichriſtianity have brought in thither.</p>
               <p>There hath been <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Perverſion,</hi> and <hi>Perverſion</hi> in the <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations, which have joyn'd themſelves to the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> ſince the eighth Age. There hath been <hi>Converſion,</hi> for they have entertained one God in three Perſons, one God Creator of Heaven and Earth, one Jeſus the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Son of God, the Word made Fleſh, who died and roſe again for the Sins of Men, who will come to Judge the Living and the Dead, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed men from their Graves, will ſend ſome men to everlaſting Torments, and ſome to the Kingdom of Heaven. This is Chriſtianity; by receiving this they became Converts to Jeſus Chriſt. There hath been <hi>Perverſion</hi> alſo; for by receiving a Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, a Vice-God upon Earth, a Soveraign to all the World, a Maſter of Kings, as of Subjects, of Crowns as of Shepherds Crooks; by adoring Bread, Angels, Saints, Reliques, and Images; they have done nothing elſe but changed their ancient <hi>Paganiſm</hi> for a new one. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, their <hi>Perverſion</hi> has not hindered their <hi>Converſion;</hi> and that they have entertained Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity, hinders not that they have not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo the Chriſtian Doctrine. So that the Gate of Converſion to Chriſtianity was never ſhut. But the queſtion is, Whether this Gate be ſaving? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Converſions be profitable, or whether we ought to ſay of the Miſſionaries of the <hi>Roman
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:49990:304"/>Church,</hi> what Chriſt Jeſus ſaid of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> That they <hi>compaſs ſea and land to make Proſelites, whom they made twofold more children of hell than themſelves?</hi> The queſtion is, Whether the Antichriſtianity which they have embraced, hath more power to deſtroy them, than the Chriſtianity which they have received, hath to ſave them? It behoves you to anſwer, that theſe People who are joyned to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the eighth Age, have ſome portion and lot with her ancient Members; that God doth nothing in vain; that he hath not converted ſo many men to Chriſtianity, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all: though it be a corrupt Chriſtianity, which in the times when there were no Churches, which were not very corrupt as well as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it may be granted that God did preſerve unto himſelf children in theſe corrupt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; that in theſe <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations which are joyned to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> God had his Elect, and that he found means to ſave theſe Elect from among the Nations by the Chriſtianity which they had embraced, and that he gave them the grace to ſeparate the Antichriſtianity, and not to be hurt or injured thereby. How this was done is not for us preciſely to determine. Theſe are the depths of the ways of God. We will ſay the ſame concerning the Converſions which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath made in the <hi>Indies:</hi> that God ſaves his Elect from among theſe Nations by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which the Miſſionaries cauſe them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and defends them from the wounds and hurts which the Antichriſtianity that is joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it might do unto them, by ways known to his profound Wiſdom. We might believe this, ſay I, were it not that according to the report that the Papiſts themſelves make unto us of the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> teach the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the <hi>Chineſees,</hi>
                  <pb n="587" facs="tcp:49990:304"/>is not ſo much as an honeſt <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> This is it which muſt be anſwered to the firſt Difficulty.</p>
               <p>Behold the ſecond: If you confeſs ſay they, that the Church is viſible, and always viſible, the Church of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> cannot be the true Church, for it was not viſible two hundred years agon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no exiſtence in the World. When you ſhall have made a diſſection of this Difficulty, you will find it the moſt pittiful one that ever was made. Know then, my Brethren, that when we ſay the Church was viſible, and always viſible, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Church Univerſal, and not any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church. By the Univerſal Church muſt be underſtood Chriſtianity diſperſed through all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the <hi>Eaſt, Weſt, North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they retain the Books of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament,</hi> with the three <hi>Greeds,</hi> which are the Abridgment of them. This Church is always viſible, for God cannot permit that ſhe periſh whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor yet that it be wholly hidden: but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches of which the Univerſal Church is made up and formed, neither have, nor can have this priviledge of being always neceſſarily viſible. For Experience makes us ſee that God permits that they periſh wholly: For Example, the great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Africa,</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Numidia,</hi> &amp;c. where were the <hi>Cyprians,</hi> the <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> the <hi>Saintes Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentii,</hi> that is to ſay, the prime Lights of the Church. Theſe Churches, ſay I, are not at all; therefore they are not viſible, and perpetual Viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was not affixed unto them. At preſent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you, that the defect of Viſibility may be found in a particular Church for one of theſe two reaſons, either becauſe ſhe is no longer, or becauſe ſhe is not yet; the Churches of <hi>Africa</hi> are inviſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are no more; and the Proteſtant Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were inviſible two hundred years ago, becauſe
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:49990:305"/>they were not yet. Underſtand, I intreat you, the folly of the Objection which they make unto you by this: <hi>The true Church is always viſible, the Church of St.</hi> Auſtine, <hi>and St.</hi> Cyprian <hi>is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er viſible, therefore the Church of St.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>and St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>was not the true Church.</hi> Can any thing be more fooliſh and ridiculous than this? You ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well underſtand what you ought to anſwer, when the Church of St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> was in the World it was viſible, and it was then the true Church, but after it was extinct and aboliſhed by the Invaſions of the <hi>Saracens</hi> and the <hi>Moors,</hi> how can you wiſh or deſire it ſhould be viſible?</p>
               <p>So when they tell you, The <hi>true Church is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways viſible, now the Church of</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Calvin <hi>was not viſible two hundred years ago, therefore it is not the true Church.</hi> You can anſwer, that a man can ſay nothing more abſurd, and that a Church is far enough from being viſible, when as yet it is not. Ah, on that occaſion they will ſay to you, the novelty of your Church is a proof of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof. For a new Church cannot be a true Church. Another Abſurdity: The Church of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> erected by the <hi>Roman</hi> Miſſions is about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince. I reaſon againſt that, as they reaſon againſt us: <hi>A new Church which was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a hundred years ſince, cannot be a true Church, for the Church is ancient, and always viſible, now the Church of</hi> China <hi>is new, and was not exiſtent a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, therefore it is not a true Church.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that they would tell me the difference, unleſs it be that the Church of <hi>China</hi> newly came out of the boſom of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and that ours is newly come out of the boſom of Antichriſtianiſm. He muſt be a little cracked in the crown, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this example, that the new erection of a particular Church ought to be no prejudice unto
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:49990:305"/>it. Nothing can prejudice it but new Doctrine: If a new Society which teaches a new Doctrine doth ariſe then in a new Church, and in that caſe is worth nothing. But they will ſay, Behold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly your own ſtate and caſe, you are a new Church that teach new things. That's the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that's it which we deny, and which muſt be examined to know whether we teach new things: We muſt therefore come to the Foundation, to ſee if we teach the ancient Religion of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and not ridiculouſly amuſe our ſelves in wrangling about circumſtances concerning a new Church, of new Eſtabliſhment, of perpetual Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, &amp;c. for if we teach the true and ancient Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, all that they ſay of theſe things are Illuſions: And if on the contrary, our Doctrine be not that of Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, though we were as old as the World, and had been always as viſible as the Sun, we ſhould be nevertheleſs a falſe Church. This is that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which I will ſtand to, that we are not to ſearch the character of perpetual Viſibility in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, foraſmuch as it agrees only to Chriſtianity in general, and the Church Univerſal. Before our Reformation the Church was not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in our Society, which did not yet exiſt, but it was viſible in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, in the <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nian, Cophti, Abyſſin,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Churches, becauſe all theſe preſerved Chriſtianity intire in the three <hi>Creeds.</hi> When we came into the World, the Church became viſible in our Society, as it was before in others, with this difference, that the Church and Chriſtianity were viſible before our Reformation, as the Egg whereof we have ſpoken was viſible in the midſt of that dirty, unclean, and filthy water in which it ſwam; and that in our Church Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity and the Church are there viſible as the
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:49990:306"/>Sun diſ-engaged from dark clouds and fogs. My Brethren, if you take pains to read and meditate deeply, and more than once upon what I have ſaid unto you, I tell you frankly, I ſhall no more fear on your behalf the Sophiſm concerning perpetual Viſibility.</p>
               <p>WHatſoever deſire we have to give you the News of our Martyrs, for this time they muſt give place to certain Prodigies, more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant than any ever happened before. The firſt ſhall be that which is come from St. <hi>Malo,</hi> atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Letter from the Vicar-General of that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick.</p>

                     <head>The Copy of a Letter from Monſieur <hi>Simon,</hi> Doctor of the <hi>Sorborn,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan, Channon,</hi> Penitentiary and Vicar-General of the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> the ſixth of <hi>July,</hi> 1687.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> Wrote to you the laſt Poſt, my dear Monſieur, but how can I forbear to tell you of a late Accident which you will hear of by the publique Relations? Behold a ſmall Extract of it, which I draw in haſte: Upon <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> laſt, being the third of this Month, the Thunder (after a very ſmall noiſe in the borders of this City) fell upon our Church, by the Steeple, killed a young Man which toll'd the Bell in the Belfery, fell into the Seat of the Quire, or Singing-men; broke all the lower part of the Crucifix in divers pieces, and left the Image hanging by its hands; it fell among the Muſicians which ſung, and anſwered at a Maſs in Muſick, that Monſieur <hi>de Sales</hi> celebrated at the Altar of St. <hi>Julien,</hi> it ſmote
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:49990:306"/>down the ſaid Sieur <hi>de Sales,</hi> with the Deacons and Sub-deacons, who were ſome time without knowledge; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned the conſecrated Calice which ſtood upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, on the Ground, and on the Garments of the Prieſts. The ſame thing happened at the Altar of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> at the entrance of the Quire: A Prieſt being at the <hi>Poſt-communion,</hi> ſaw in an inſtant (in a Chalice which fell not) one part of the Blood of our Lord conſumed; the reſt ſprinkled upon the Ornaments of the Prieſts, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Linnen of the Altar. Monſieur <hi>Lagons</hi> being at the <hi>Credo</hi> of the Maſs, at the Altar of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> was thrown upon his back, and there the Sacrifice ceaſed. The Thunder broke many parts of the Veſtrie, burnt the Altar-cloaths, and left a mark upon the Pattin, as if it had been ſhot with a Piſtol, it left many other marks upon the edge of the Chalice. In the Quire one named <hi>Banville,</hi> the beſt Voice of our Church, whoſe back was near the Crucifix, remained there as dead, and was there a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling, ſight, or knowledge; it is not known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he can be recovered; for they ſay, to day, that all his back is burnt, and that he vomits his entrails. The Gentlemen of the Chapter take all poſſible care of him. As it was the firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> of the Month, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Maſs of the Sacrament, the Church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly full; very many ſwoon'd, and were carried off without knowledge. The Church appeared for ſometime all on a fire, and filled with a thick black ſmoak, and a very ſtinking ſavour. It would take more time than I have, to make you an exact Picture of our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. I was in the Chapter-houſe upon the Tower, cloſe by the place where the Thunder fell. I thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to write to my Lord of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> at <hi>Beignon,</hi> five Leagues from hence, to have his Orders and Advice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this whole matter. Our Expreſs went thither in a few hours, and my Lord came hither on Horſe-back, with two or three only of his men, where a great and famous Proceſſion was prepared againſt the Afternoon, at
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:49990:307"/>which all the body of the Religions were to attend at three of the Clock. Behold the Advertiſements which God has given us, which afford fair occaſion for Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Adieu.</hi> I am wholly yours. <hi>About two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, the Thunder fell nigh the ſame place.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is not ſafe in this Age to entertain the Publick with Prodigees, and yet much leſs to draw Conſequences and Preſages thence, nevertheleſs this ſpeaks ſo loud, that he muſt be as deaf as a rock that hears not: The Thunder almoſt without any Tempeſt falls into the Church, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the Images, breaks the Crucifix, goes directly to three Prieſts, ſaying Maſs at three different Altars, burns the Ornaments of the Altars, conſumes the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, (as they call it) in one of the Chalices, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the other, imprints the mark of a Piſtol-ſhot on the Pattin, kills the moſt famous Singer, fills the Church with a moſt horrible ſtink. Behold enough! it needs no Commentary. Mr. <hi>Simon</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that theſe are Advertiſements from God, which give fair occaſion for Reflections. We deſire theſe Gentlemen, at the ſame time, to do ſo upon that which happened at <hi>Paris,</hi> upon <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> day, which we will report alſo as it hath been written by an infinite number of perſons.</p>
                     <p>The laſt <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> day, in this Year, <hi>1687.</hi> in moſt places it was as calm as any Summer-day could be. On the contrary, it was very tempeſtuous almoſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>France;</hi> they could not make their Proceſſions at <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and other places of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> becauſe of the Rain. And the ſame Tempest was alſo at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Sacrament, being brought out of the Church of St. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> had not gon far, when the Wind, or a Blow from Heaven ſmote down the Pix, or Box, in which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Hoſt was carried, to the ground. It fell into the Water and Dirt, the Veſſel opened, and the Hoſt fell out, and mingling with the Dirt, was confounded and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:49990:307"/>by it. And all the care which they could take to reſtore it, by taking away the Dirt, the Water, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Ground that ſtuck to it, could not hinder it from ſuffering the utmoſt indignities. Let him that pleaſe make Reflections, I cannot forbear obſerving it as a viſible Judgment from God, and as a Preſage. In the greateſt of the Popiſh Feſtivals, in the greateſt City, where Bread-worſhip reigns, in the going out of a Church, which bears one of the Names of Jeſus Chriſt, and which ought not to be given to any thing but himſelf, the Idol of Bread fell with its face on the ground, and was buried in the Mire.</p>
                     <p>Behold a third Matter of Fact, which is not leſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, it is the burning of the great Church of <hi>Rochel:</hi> this Church was formerly the great Church of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. They took it away from them after the Siege and taking of the City. Every one knows, that the day on which the Inhabitants made a Bon-fire, the fire took hold on this large and fair Church, none knows how, nor where, and that it was conſumed, the Lead was mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the Vaults burnt, without being able to quench it: there is ſomething ſingular in the event, the day, and the occaſion, and 'tis impoſſible not to ſee the finger of God therein. God grant, that it may ſignifie, that the Life and Health of the King may not be ſo favourable to the Perſecutors, as they hope.</p>
                     <p>If you would have Matters of Fact like that of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> behold here are ſome: There happened one at <hi>God-derville,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Caux,</hi> upon <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi> day, as the Inhabitants diſcharged their Muskets to the Honour of the Sacrament, the fire took hold of ſome Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ran in ſuch a manner, that there was more than <hi>80</hi> burnt down. On the third day of <hi>July,</hi> the very ſame day that the Thunder fell upon the Church of St. <hi>Malo,</hi> at Seven of the Clock at Night, the Thunder likewiſe fell upon the Church of a Place called <hi>Pouille,</hi> ſituated in <hi>Normandy,</hi> carried away the Weather-cock from the
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:49990:308"/>Steeple, entered into the Church, and burnt all the Altars. It alſo fell at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

In the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs of St. <hi>Gervas</hi> of <hi>Roan.</hi> It carried away the Roof of a Garden-houſe belonging to the Curate of the Pariſh. It muſt be confeſſed, that the Thunder hath done much this Year to Churches, and all things belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                     <p>After theſe notorious Matters of Fact, which ſpeak ſo loud, it may be permitted us to report two others contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Memorial, which was ſent us from <hi>Poictou</hi> by a very honourable perſon.</p>

                     <p>AT <hi>Jaſeneuil,</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> there happened this which follows, while Mr. <hi>Marillac</hi> did ſuch miſchiefs in the ſaid Province. A Peaſant, by Name, <hi>— Bardon,</hi> married to a Wife of the Roman Catholick Perſuaſion, who preſſed him vehemently to change his Religion; meeting the Curate of the place, in the Field, ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded to go to Maſs, and to change his Religion. Which when he had done, he immediately repented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, greatly, as he ſaid to one of his Neighbours, whom he found as he returned home; and being come to his Houſe, while his Spirit was in diſorder, inſtead of opening his Lock, he hampered it in ſuch ſort, that he was forced to ſend for a Lockſmith to take it off: when the Door was open, he ſaw all the Chamber on fire, and he crying out Fire, five or ſix of his Neighbours ran, with his Wife, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſaw this miraculous Fire, which filled all the Chamber, and burnt nothing, and in the end diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd. This Man, ſome days after, fell ſick, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, without ceaſing, that he would give him
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:49990:308"/>the grace, that he might never return to the Maſs, and to this purpoſe, that he would take him out of the World; and becauſe that he well ſaw, that his only Son would be forced to follow that Religion in which he began to be engaged, he prayed God to take his Son out of the World, and that he might ſee him die before he died himſelf. Two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Son fell ſick, and in two days he died in the preſence of his Father, and the Father himſelf died the day after, rendring a thouſand Thanks to God, that he had heard his Prayer, and that he had taken them both out of this World to give them a better Life.</p>
                     <p>I learnt this Story from St. <hi>Maixent,</hi> the 10th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1684. from two perſons worthy of credit, <hi>viz.</hi> the Husband and Wife who had a Child nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Wife of the ſaid <hi>Bardon;</hi> he which made me the Report of this Matter, is called Mr. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergnac,</hi> Maſter of the Grange of the Village of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zignan</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> a perſon of good credit, and full of zeal for Religion, his Wife alſo being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>

            <p>BEfore we paſs to another part of the Controverſie about the Church, and leave the Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its perpetual viſibility, and after examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the viſibility of the Church in general, 'tis needful that we take cognizance of the viſibility of the Roman Church in particular: 'Tis needful that you ſay to your Converters, ſince 'tis ſo, that the Church is always viſible, and that you are the Church, help us to ſee her; in and by what is the Roman Church viſible? If they ſhew you great Churches full of Men, that pray, and adore, which hear <hi>Veſpers</hi> and <hi>Mattins,</hi> who proſtrate themſelves before Wafers and Images, you will anſwer, this is not to ſhew me the Church. For if I were at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> a Turk would ſhew me his Moſques all full of Worſhippers, which cry, <hi>there is but one God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.</hi> Tell them, If you
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:49990:310"/>pleaſe to go to <hi>London,</hi> I will ſhew you the Church in <hi>England,</hi> as you ſhew it me in <hi>France:</hi> I will ſhew you great Churches full of men, which pray, and adore, which proſtrate themſelves before God, who pray, and underſtand what they pray for. 'Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable therefore, that you ſhew me not Men, and heaps of Stones, which are called Churches, but ſenſible and viſible marks, that Popery is the true Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church. Add to this, that the marks which they give you ought to be ſuitable to your capacity, <hi>i. e.</hi> the capacity of plain perſons, and without learning. For the ſpace of twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years the Popiſh Doctors of <hi>France</hi> have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Controverſie this way. The buſineſs is not to inſtruct the learned, 'tis acknowledged on both ſides, that the multitude, and greater part of the Church, is compoſed of men without learning, and of plain people, which muſt be ſaved as well as the more able. From henceforth therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to furniſh a means to the common people, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of the truth in matters of controverſie, and a means altogether ſuitable to their weakneſs. Particularly in this Controverſie, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath certain and evident marks of her truth, which make her viſible. For 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affair, and which the weakeſt ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. It is certain, that a Church cannot be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in quality of a Church, by any other means than what they call her marks; of this we are at an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore ſee, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath thoſe marks, which may make the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perceive ſhe is a true Church. I will not here ingage you in that Labyrinth of Diſputes, which the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the marks of that Church. 'Tis their manner
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:49990:310"/>to bury the truth under a prodigious heap of uſeleſs words and obſcure queſtions. I will not examine the ſixteen marks which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has given, nor the forty which others have produced. You cannot read thoſe Books, nor are they thoſe which they put into your hands; and ſince that time, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more able in Sophiſtry. Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who is the laſt that hath laboured on this Subject, has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed three <hi>Chapters</hi> to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is very viſible, even to the moſt weak, and plain. In the firſt of theſe three <hi>Chapters,</hi> he ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 17, 18, 19, of the 1ſt Book, <hi>The Reformed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Schiſm.</hi>
               </note> That <hi>a man may prove the Church to the weakeſt by Scripture.</hi> In the ſecond, That <hi>a man may prove the Church to the moſt weak by Tradition.</hi> And in the third, That <hi>the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not unfurniſhed with exterior marks, which make her known to be the true Church to the weak.</hi> Behold three Sources of viſibility for the Roman Church:
<list>
                  <item>1. Tradition.</item>
                  <item>2. Exterior Marks.</item>
                  <item>3. The Scripture As this is one of the Books which your Converters put into your hands, I do intreat you to give attention to what I have to ſay to you thereon.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with Tradition. They underſtand by Tradition, the Teſtimony of the Fathers, Councils, and Authors of all Ages, therefore the meaning is, they can prove the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the true Church by the teſtimony of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, and by the Councils of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church. And at firſt, this is a contradiction that ſtares you in the face. <hi>It may be proved,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the weak by the Fathers, and the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Church.</hi> And how can a man prove to the weak, a truth by the teſtimonies of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers? To thoſe which underſtand neither <hi>Latin</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> or who
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:49990:311"/>have neither means nor time to turn over the Leaves, or read and examine theſe great Volumes. Behold the way, nothing more remains than to employ theſe two means, the firſt is a Principle founded on a Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin, that all Cuſtoms that are found univerſally eſtabliſhed whoſe original and beginning we know not, may be very juſtly aſcribed to the Apoſtles.</hi> The ſecond means is included in this Syllogiſm which Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> makes. The Scripture and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition teach, that there hath been always in the World one Church, viſible and ſucceſſive, and that this Church is infallible for the inſtruction of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the truths of Faith.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is this only viſible Church.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the infallible Church, and to her alone it belongs to inſtruct men in the truths of Faith.</p>
            <p>And behold how Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> forms a light upon the firſt <hi>medium</hi> which makes the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the weak. <hi>All the Traditions which the Hereticks diſpute,</hi> ſaye he, <hi>have their certain Epoche's or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings which are not diſputed by them.</hi> The <hi>Calviniſts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that in the fourth Age men called upon Saints, adored Reliques, and obſerved <hi>Lent,</hi> that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Age they worſhipped Images, in the eleventh they believed Tranſubſtantiation: The weak have no need to aſſure themſelves of this matter of fact by way of examination, for 'tis confeſſed on both ſides. Apply the Principle of St. <hi>Auſtin, that all Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms found univerſally eſtabliſhed in one Age, and whoſe beginning we know not, may be juſtly attributed to the Apoſtles.</hi> Now the cuſtoms of invoking Saints, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Images, obſerving <hi>Lent,</hi> and worſhipping the Sacrament, are found generally eſtabliſhed in ſome Ages, as the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> confeſs, and we know not where to find the original of them, therefore they
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:49990:311"/>ought to be referred to the Apoſtles. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how many Illuſions there are therein, which are unworthy of an honeſt man, yea, a man of a good underſtanding. Firſt, 'tis to ſcoff at mankind, to ſay, 'tis a light proper to make the Church viſible to the weak. For this method of reaſoning doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe,
<list>
                  <item>1. That a perſon muſt know that this pretended Rule, on which they ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Miniſters conſent to the truth of this rule.</item>
                  <item>3. That they confeſs, that upon certain times, the cuſtoms of adoring Images, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were generally received.</item>
                  <item>4. That from thence it follows, that theſe cuſtoms, generally eſtabliſhed in ſome Ages, ought to be referred to the Apoſtles.</item>
               </list> All this is diſputed, and there are large Books written on the Subject, which the weak can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read, and this requires an examination, which is above the capacity of thoſe which are not men of learning. This is that which we have proved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly in our Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Syſtem of the Church,</hi> l. 2. c. 16.</note>. Secondly, It is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that this fine Principle upon which this pretended Evidence is founded, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rule of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is falſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be applied to all Ages. It hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Fathers of the fourth Age were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much inclined to ſupport the Novelties crept into the Church upon the authorities of the Apoſtles, and to make all things paſs for Apoſtolick, the beginning whereof the People were not then able to ſee. It is therefore falſe, that all Cuſtoms which are found eſtabliſh'd in a certain Age, although we be not able to find the beginning of them, in a diſtinct manner ought to be aſcribed to the Apoſtles. For example, The cuſtom of adoring the Sacrament of the Euchariſt was not generally eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Latin.</hi> Church till the twelfth Age. Although we
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:49990:312"/>could not find the original of this Idolatry, it were an impiety to attribute it to the Apoſtles. There are certain Practices which are inſenſibly eſtabliſhed by little and little, the firſt point of whoſe original can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preciſely obſerved. It doth not follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we muſt aſcribe the original to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. We muſt attribute nothing to the Apoſtles but what is in their Writings. 3. I obſerve, that there is a faulty and ſhameful falſeneſs in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Rule. Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> pretends, that the Cuſtoms which are found generally eſtabliſhed in certain Ages, ought to be referred to the Apoſtles, and that for this reaſon, the cuſtom of falling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before Images muſt be referred to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this cuſtom is found generally eſtabliſhed in the eighth Age. I do maintain, that Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> does baſely betray his conſcience in this example, for he is perſwaded as well as I, and all thoſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks in <hi>France,</hi> which are men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, do know, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did not eſtabliſh Image-worſhip; and theſe Gentlemen do not refuſe to confeſs it, when they are not in diſpute. Fourthly, I ſay, that this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſes a thing which is altogether falſe, 'tis that we are not able to find the original of thoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which are generally eſtabliſhed in certain Ages: this is falſe, the cuſtom of praying to Saints is found eſtabliſhed in the fifth Age. In our prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Letters, we have ſhewn the original and birth thereof. In like manner we find in all the following Ages the birth of the Worſhip of Images, of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Real Preſence, and Tranſubſtantiation. They make a wrangling with us about it, unworthy of honeſt men. Shew us, ſay they, who was the firſt Heretick that taught ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Invocation of Saints, or the Worſhip of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or thoſe other falſe Worſhips which you condemn.</p>
            <pb n="603" facs="tcp:49990:312"/>
            <p>I anſwer, that I have no need to name their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſeeing I have ſhewn the Age of their birth. I prove for example, after a manner invincible, that they did not invocate Saints in the three firſt Ages of the Church. I find afterwards the Invocation of Saints about the end of the fourth Age. Is not this to obſerve the point of its birth? what does the name of the firſt Author ſignifie in this caſe? Beſides, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and idolatrous Practices had not one ſingle Author, they had many, 'tis the ſottiſh and ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed people who introduce Superſtitions, and who introduce them inſenſibly, and by little and little. But for ſpeculative Hereſies, 'tis the learned which give them birth, for which reaſon 'tis eaſie to mark both their Authors, and the preciſe time of their original. Fifthly, To conclude, I obſerve in this light which Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> forms to us, to make the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> viſible, there is no more of ſound judgment, than of honeſty. For although even all that he ſays were ſolid, and his method would prove the Invocation of Saints, the Adoration of Reliques, <hi>Lent, &amp;c.</hi> were Apoſtolical Traditions, this would not prove, that which ought to be proved here, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the only true Church. For it muſt be known, that the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Papiſts is ſchiſmatical, and which a man cannot ſecure his ſalvation, do alſo invocate Saints, worſhip Images, and obſerve <hi>Lent.</hi> 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to find in Tradition a proof which makes it evident, that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is the true Church, with excluſion to all other Sects; and this is it which the reaſoning of Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> doth not prove neither directly, nor indirectly.</p>
            <p>The other Source from whence Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> will draw a light by Tradition, to make the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> viſible to the weak, is yet more dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. 'Tis a ratiocination, which ſuppoſes,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:49990:313"/>Tradition teaches, that there hath been a viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church in the World.</hi> Tradition doth not teach it, and although it ſhould teach it, a plain weak man which cannot read the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, the Councils, and the Opinions of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors would not be in a condition to aſſure himſelf thereof.</item>
                  <item>2. This reaſoning ſuppoſes in its ſecond Propoſition, <hi>that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is this only vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible infallible Church.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> And this is that which muſt be proved, that is, that which is obſcure, and muſt be made plain to the eyes of the weak. Is it not therefore very abſurd to pretend to make a light for the weak to render the Roman Church viſible, of that which is denied and conteſted by all the World? yea, although it ſhould be true, that there is one vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and infallible Church, it would not follow, that this were the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> for three fourth parts of Chriſtians diſpute this priviledge with her. Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> hath found an admirable ſecret to draw the weak out of this difficulty. It is not needful, as he inſinuates, to make known to the weak, that there be other Sects as ancient as the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who pretend to be the Church. Nothing more is neceſſary than to make them ſee the new Sects of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> For they will eaſily ſee, that this viſible Church, which ought always to be in the World, cannot be that of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, and they will not be ſo much as tempted to ſearch any other Church but that of</hi> Rome. I think I have preſſed Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> thereon, after ſuch a manner, as to cover him with a confuſion, out of which he will never eſcape. For I have made him ſee, that it is properly to cheat the weak, to let them believe there is no other Church in the World but the Roman and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant. The Proteſtant Church not having the marks of perpetual viſibility, ſince ſhe was not till
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:49990:313"/>about two hundred years ago, the weak, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring further, believe, that the Roman Church is the only true Church, on ſuppoſition, that ſhe is the only ancient Church. Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> confeſſes, that this ſuppoſition is falſe, for he acknowledges the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is as ancient as the Roman. But ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, according to him, 'tis expedient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the weak to believe this falſe ſuppoſition as if it were true, that they be not tempted to ſearch any other Church but the Roman. On this matter of fact, and about all the reſt of the Book againſt Mr. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> we do declare to him, that his ſilence is look'd upon as a conviction. They write, that he prepares an Anſwer to the firſt Part of the Syſtem of the Church, where the Nature of the Church is ſpoken to. If it be ſo, we declare to him, that that is not the capital Controverſie between him and me. 'Tis about the impoſſibility of examination of particular Controverſies, 'tis about the Authority of the Church, which he ought to anſwer, and to which he will never anſwer.</p>
            <p>the 2d light which Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> forms to make the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> viſible, is drawn from the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal marks, which make her known for the true Church to the weak and ignorant.</hi> Theſe external marks, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, may be reduced to two, they are <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Sanctity.</hi> Now this Sanctity and theſe Miracles which muſt make the Roma Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, are either thoſe of the preſent, or thoſe of paſt Ages. Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſearches the viſibility of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> more in the Miracles of the firſt Ages, than in thoſe of this. And behold how he reaſons, the Church of the two or three firſt Ages, had marks ſufficiently evident of the Divine Spirit wherewithal ſhe was animated, the miraculous Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of her Members, and the Miracles which were done there, made her ſufficiently viſible, and
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:49990:314"/>ſufficiently ſupported her authority. If the Church of the three firſt Ages had this character both of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and evidence, we cannot refuſe it to the Church of the fourth Age, for 'twas the ſame Church. <hi>She poſſeſſed all the advantages of the three firſt Ages:</hi> That is to ſay, her Miracles, and her Prodigies of Sanctity <hi>which appertained to her by right of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſhe had thoſe which were her own, and which were not inferiour to them.</hi> For ſhe had her Martyrs, her Prodigies of Sanctity, and her Miracles, and theſe Miracles were done in that ſame Church where by the confeſſion of the Miniſters, they prayed to Saints, and worſhipped Reliques. Theſe Prodigies of Sanctity, and theſe Miracles, did yet continue in thoſe Ages, in which the Miniſters do confeſs that they had Images, and believed Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. For example, in the Age of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which is the 12th. This St. <hi>Bernard</hi> wrought Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and taught all that which is believed in the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> Follow on from Age to Age, and you will come even to the Church of the preſent Age, who hath right to attribute to her ſelf not only the Miracles of the Apoſtles, but all thoſe which have been wrought ſince, and above all, thoſe which were done by the Reliques of Saints in the fourth and fifth Ages. <hi>As the Miracles which St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to have been done by the Reliques of St.</hi> Stephen <hi>in</hi> Africa, <hi>thoſe of St.</hi> Martyn <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and thoſe of the</hi> Anacorites <hi>in</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Syria.</p>
            <p>Not to enter into a long diſpute on the ſubject of this pretended mark of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer three or four things briefly, to which I pray give attention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this pretended fountain of light, fit and proper to make the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> viſible, is not for the ſimple and unlearned. For to ſee the bottom and ſolidity thereof, they muſt examine the Hiſtory of
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:49990:314"/>the pretended Miracles which were done in the fourth and fifth Ages. They muſt ſee what we have ſaid in oppoſition to it, they muſt examine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſee if there be not reaſon to believe, that all theſe ſtories of Miracles are either frauds, or fictions. They muſt alſo examine by Hiſtory, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe pretended Prodigies of Sanctity, be not either Fables, or the diſorders of ſick and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick minds. They muſt therefore be able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> and to read great and large Volumes. To offer this as a light ſutable to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the weak and unlearned, is to ſcoff and deride them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay, that the Miracles of the Apoſtles, which are certain, and the Prodigies of the Sanctity of the three firſt Ages, does not appertain by right of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Church of the fourth and fifth Age, but as far as ſhe inherits the Doctrine of the Apoſtles. Theſe Miracles were good to prove the Divinity of the Chriſtian Religion to <hi>Pagans.</hi> But they are worth nothing to prove Novelties, as are the Invocation of Saints, and the Worſhip of Reliques, which are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Pagan</hi> Practices. With far greater reaſon the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath no right by ſucceſſion to the Miracles of the Apoſtles, to prove her Worſhip, her Idolatries, and Superſtitions. We have as much right as ſhe to theſe Miracles. They are truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly our Miracles. They are good for us all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon againſt the ungodly, and againſt Infidels, to prove, that there is one God in three Perſons, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah and the true Redeemer of the World. But they are nothing to prove our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, our Corruptions, and our Alterations, if it be ſo, that either the one or the other of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sects, whether <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced them into the Church. This is clear, the Miracles of the Apoſtles appertain not to us;
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:49990:315"/>but as far as we have and do inherit their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Miracles of the fourth and fifth Age, which were done in the times when they prayed to Saints, and worſhipped Reliques, we ſay, that they were falſe Miracles. It is to be obſerved, that from the death of the Apoſtles, until the end of the fourth Age, nothing was ſpoken of Miracles in the Church, or ſo little, and in ſo doubtful a manner, that it doth not deſerve to be reckoned for any thing, but when the Devil deſired to ſet up the Worſhip of Creatures, he poured out a Spirit of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Spirit of Credulity, which began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain diſcourſes of Miracles. 'Tis a thing of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, preſs your Converters thereon. Why did theſe Miracles ceaſe for the ſpace of well nigh two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, or at leaſt why were they ſo rare? And why did they begin again exactly at the time when the Worſhip of Reliques grew famous? Do we not ſee clearly, that 'tis a Wile of the Devil? Hath God any intereſt to ſerve by Bones and Aſhes? was it neceſſary that he ſhould begin again to do Miracles at that time? And if it were of uſe to perſwade the truth of the Religion which the Martyrs declared to the <hi>Pagans,</hi> why did not God work Miracles by the Bones of the Martyrs for the firſt three Ages? This had been much more profitable, than when <hi>Paganiſm</hi> was rampant, and the Church perſecuted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Wherefore did not the Bones of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> of whom the believers of <hi>Smyrna</hi> ſpeak with ſo much love, work miracles? Why did not ſo many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, whoſe Reliques they had, and whoſe Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries they obſerved in the time of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> work ſigns and wonders? your Converters will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to anſwer this; be you therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that theſe pretended Miracles done by the Reliques of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> St. <hi>Gervais,</hi> St. <hi>Protais,</hi> St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi>
               <pb n="681" facs="tcp:49990:315"/>&amp;c. were Illuſions of the Devil, whom God permitted to work falſe Miracles, or the Cheats of Villains, and lewd Superſtitioniſts; or to conclude, Stories of the Vulgar, and Fables which honeſt men received as Truths upon hear-ſay. And as to the Miracles which are aſcribed to the <hi>Anacorites</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> I know not how Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> is not aſhamed to draw from them a Light to make his Church viſible. They are Fables for the moſt part ſo groſs, that the Falſeneſs of them ſtares in the face of the moſt Ignorant. The Lives of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite, of <hi>Hilarion,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers written by St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> that of St. <hi>Antony</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as they ſay, by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> are written with ſo little modeſty and judgment, that a man ought to be aſhamed of them.</p>
            <p>The judicious Readers that would preſerve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the Authors of thoſe Lives, ſay, that the Fathers compoſed them not as Hiſtories, but as pious Romances to divert Chriſtians from read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pagan</hi> Fables. We ſee in the Lives of thoſe ſolitary perſons of the Deſart, ſuch as found Centaurs in the Woods, Satyrs, Men half Horſes, and half Goats, who ſpake to them, and prayed them to intreat the common Saviour to have pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on them, and to give them part in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation with them. We ſee Hermites-which were in perpetual conteſts with the Devil, always tempted, and often beaten by him. We ſee them which herded among the Beaſts. We there read in one word, almoſt all the Impertinencies of our new Legends. This makes it evident, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Spirit entred into Chriſtian Religion, as ſoon as the Spirit of Superſtition, and Idolatry. <hi>4ly,</hi> I ſay that although it ſhould be true, that theſe Miracles wrought in the Age of the eſtabliſhment of the Worſhip of Saints and Reliques, ſhould be
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:49990:316"/>true Miracles, it would not be a Light for the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> any more than for the <hi>Greek,</hi> who alſo worſhip Saints and Reliques. 'Tis therefore needful that we have Miracles from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> ſince ſhe was ſeparate from the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and that it appear this Gift of Miracles is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all other Churches to affix itſelf to the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> Now the <hi>Greek</hi> Schiſmaticks have their Saints, their Legends, and their Miracles, as well as the <hi>Latine Church:</hi> Beſides, we do maintain that all the Miracles of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> thoſe of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> as well as others, are Legendaries, Tales, or Illuſions of the Evil Spirit. 5ly, To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I do maintain that every perſon who hath no other ſupport of his Faith but Miracles, is a falſe Believer. I have ſaid it elſewhere, Miracles are not deſigned principally to prove Truth; they are appointed above all to awaken mens minds, to oblige them to give attention to Truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> to the Miracles and Prodigies of Sanctity of the Ancients, which make the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to him, viſible, joyns alſo the Sanctity of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Orders, her great Men, the Nuns <hi>de Trap,</hi> &amp;c. and concludes, <hi>That although a man ſhould have regard to nothing but the Sanctity of the Manners of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>ſhe is even thereby diſtinguiſhed from all other Societies, and that ſhe hath, in perſons of eminent Piety, ſenſible Characters of the Spirit of God, which will animate and inſpire her to the end of the World.</hi> Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſpeaking of all preceding Ages, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways joyn Miracles with Sanctity: At preſent he lays by Miracles, and why is this? He well knows his Church pretends, as yet, to have the Gift of Miracles. And there is not a place eminent for Devotion, as are the famous Ladies of <hi>Arſillieres,</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> of <hi>Loretto,</hi> where they do not pretend to
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:49990:316"/>ſee Miracles. The Father <hi>de Aviano</hi> ran all the World over to make it evident, that the Gift of Miracles did not dye with the Apoſtles. He dares not produce to us, that as a Light, he perceives ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that all theſe Miracles are ſuſpected. Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he himſelf hath not much Faith for them. And ſo by this ſilence Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> doth tacitly conſent, that at this day the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. If it be ſo, I would very willingly know why the <hi>Roman</hi> Church worke no more Miracles at this day, when ſhe had never more need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to convert ſo many ill converted Hereticks, and which cry out ſo loudly of the Violence which they have ſuffered by the ſending of the Dragoons? The Miracles whereof they tell us, as done at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, may very well be Juggles or Fables, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what <hi>Mr. Nicholas</hi> lets us think by ſaying nothing of them, for what reaſon may not all thoſe of the Ages paſt for ſeven or eight hundred years particularly, be very well alſo accounted Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures? Theſe Miracles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Popery,</hi> do very well deſerve that we ſhould make larger Reflections on them, and an occaſion thereof will be preſented to us elſewhere. But in the mean while, I pray give attention to this: It is if they reckon the Miracles which are found in the Legends from the fifth Age, wrought expreſly to ſupport the Invocation of Saints, Adoration of Reliques, Worſhip of Images, and of Purgatory, it will be found, that God hath wrought without Hyperbole, a thouſand times more Miracles for the eſtabliſhment of theſe falſe Doctrines, theſe wicked Worſhips, than he hath wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Chriſtian Religion. We have told you long ſince, that a Monk for his part raiſed two and fifty dead perſons, and others in proportion. Now judge if it were probable that theſe new Doctrines;
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:49990:317"/>ſuppoſing they were true, ſhould be ſo important that to confirm them, God ſhould work a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times more wonders, than he hath wrought to eſtabliſh the Faith of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Myſteries of the Chriſtian Religion. As to the Article of the Holineſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, whereof <hi>Mr. Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Mr. Arnold</hi> make an evidence for her, I can deſtroy it by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king appear the enormous Corruptions which are yet ſeen in her moſt conſiderable parts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy:</hi> I can prove the diſorders of her Clergy, and of her Monks; I can prove that theſe prodigious Auſterities which they produce to us as the effects of the Spirit of God, are but the effects of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Hypocriſie, or Fanaticiſm. But to the end that I may not trouble thoſe that pride themſelves of the Virtue and Piety in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I will ſay, that if there be Piety in ſome of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Church, they owe it not to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Antichriſtianiſm, but to the remainders of Chriſtianity which continue in that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I come to the third Light by which Mr. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> would make the Church viſible: It is the Holy Scripture. To conclude, behold him come to the only place from whence the true Light can be drawn: <hi>It is falſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that this Author hath believed that the point concerning the Church cannot be proved by the Scriptures, and that the proofs are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the capacity of the Vulgar.</hi> We have ſhewn Mr. <hi>Nicholas</hi> how much there is of Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in what he ſays here, that a man may prove the point concerning the Church by the Scripture, after a manner that is fitted to the capacity of the Vulgar: and yet we know not how to prove the other Articles of Faith which are controverted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner. It hath been made evident,
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:49990:317"/>that the Controverſie concerning the Church, is the moſt difficult of all. It hath been repreſented to him, that to deſide this Controverſie by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, according to the method which he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt us, it is neceſſary that an ignorant man ſhould be able to compare the Tranſlations with the Originals, and by conſequence, that he ſhould underſtand <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that he may be able to read the Commentaries of the Ancients, and the Moderns, and by conſequence, that he ſhould be able to underſtand <hi>Latine.</hi> All this is as neceſſary to determine one ſingle Controverſie, as to determine a hundred. We have proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that it is falſe to ſay, that a man may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well prove by Scripture the Soveraign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church, but that he cannot prove there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Trinity or Incarnation, and on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he is reduced to an eternal ſilence. For which reaſon we ſhall not preſs him farther on an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which he grants us by his ſilence. But it is neceſſary to acquaint you, that his Affirmation is intirely falſe and raſh, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture furniſhes ſufficient Light to the Vulgar, to make them ſee that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the true Church. Either theſe Gentlemen mean, that by the Scripture they can eaſily prove that there ought to be always a viſible and infallible Church upon Earth, or they mean that the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhews with its finger the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and makes it known for the true Church, to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all other Sects of Chriſtians; or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they mean the Holy Scripture forms a Light to make the <hi>Roman Church</hi> viſible, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, includes, and teaches all the Doctrines and Worſhip which this Church doth authorize and command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="686" facs="tcp:49990:318"/>
As to the firſt ſence, although it ſhould be true Popery would gain nothing thereby; although they ſhould prove even by the Scripture, that there ought always to be a viſible and infallible Church upon Earth, this would not prove that this muſt be the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> Church pretends to be that Church <hi>which is built upon the rock, and againſt which the gates of hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail,</hi> to the excluſion of the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, and 'tis that in which we ought to obſerve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Illuſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors. They op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs you with Sophiſms, to convince you that there ought to be a Judge, an infallible Interpreter of Scripture, a Church that cannot err. Anſwer them in one word, Although all this which you ſay ſhould be true, it would be no advantage to you; we muſt ſeek this Church, and this infallible Interpreter elſewhere, for 'tis certain you have er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I come to the ſecond ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Scripture makes a Light which renders the Church viſible, becauſe it ſhews with the Finger the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church as the true Church to the excluſion of all others. Now this is a Falſhood ſenſible to all the World, the Holy Scripture ſpeaks not one word of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of her Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 'Tis true there is an Epiſtle addreſſed to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo little thought of her as infallible, that he ſpeaks to her as a Church that would fall, or at leaſt as one that might be cut off from the true Olive, and from the root of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>There remains only the third ſence in which your Converters can ſay, that the Scripture forms a Light which makes the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> viſible: 'Tis that the Doctrine of the Scripture is found perfectly conformable to that of the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> That is it which they muſt ſay, if they will ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:49990:318"/>thing that is ſolid: for the truth is, that there is not any mark of the Church but this, <hi>viz.</hi> Her conformity to the Holy Scripture. Let alone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all this pretended heap of Marks of the Church, which are either falſe, or equivocal, and keep you cloſe to this alone. Tell your Converters, if you will make your Church viſible to me, let me ſee it conformable to the Scripture; and 'tis there you will reduce them to Extremities. 'Tis here that we have an evident proof that Popery is an Antichriſtian Religion. Behold a proof to which all the ſubtilty of Hell can never oppoſe any thing; we ſay then, every Society, and every Religion which hath nothing conformable with the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, is not the true Religion; now Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath nothing conformable to the Law of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, therefore it hath nothing of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>I intreat you to give attention to this: If a Sect of the <hi>Turks,</hi> calling themſelves <hi>Mahometans,</hi> had nothing among them like to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which is the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> would you not tell them that they lie? If the <hi>Jews</hi> calling themſelves <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould re-eſtabliſh a Worſhip which hath nothing like the Worſhip preſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> would any one endure that they ſhould ſay they were of the Religion of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Every Religion hath its Books, and every Sect (to ſhew that 'tis of ſuch a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ought to prove its conformity with thoſe Books. Common ſence ſay thus: If therefore <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> have nothing at all like the Writings of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 'tis clear that 'tis not Chriſtianity. Now this is it which we take for granted, and which we are ready to prove before all ſorts of Judges, even <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans, viz.</hi> That <hi>Popery</hi> hath no conformity with the Scripture, which is the common Law of Chriſtians. To be convinced of this, my Brethren,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:49990:319"/>firſt ſeparate Chriſtianity from <hi>Popery</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and don't ſuffer yourſelves to be blinded by what your Converters ſay unto you: Are not we Chriſtians? Do we not believe one God in three Perſons, one Jeſus crucified for the ſins of men, one Reſurrection, one Paradiſe, and one Hell? Does not the Scripture teach all this? Is not our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion therefore conformable to Revelation? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them thereon, Yea, you are Chriſtians in all that you believe with us; but you are Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in that wherein you believe without us. Theſe points whereof you ſpeak are in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture 'tis true, but 'tis my Religion rather than yours; 'tis Chriſtianity whereof 'tis true I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you have preſerved the Fundamentals: But this makes nothing for your Religion, which is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> it makes nothing for Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Adoration of Images, and Reliques, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, the Adoration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue in the Worſhip of God, a Communion without the Cup, a Head of the Church beſides Jeſus Chriſt. Behold Popery, and 'tis that which we maintain hath no conformity with the Scripture. Indeed when your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will prove their Doctrines by the Scripture, it ſeems they have renounced common Sence, as well as Faith and Honeſty. To underſtand this, there is no need to examine any Books of Controverſie, as they would fain perſwade you, there needs no more but eyes to open and read them. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: When they endeavour to prove the <hi>Pope</hi> is the Soveraign Head of the Church, the Center of Unity, the Mouth that utters Oracles, and him to whom we muſt adhere if we will be ſaved, and they produce to us, for the whole proof, theſe words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this rock I will build my Church; I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:49990:319"/>not; feed my ſheep.</hi> When, ſay I, they produce this, and produce nothing elſe to prove the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point of <hi>Popery,</hi> which is the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> I do maintain, that he muſt be ſtricken with a Spirit of Blockiſhneſs to regard it as proof. He muſt, I dare ſay, be abandoned to a Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, to ſuppoſe that the Scripture, that tells us of Paſtors and Teachers, as Guides of the Church, ſhould not ſpeak one word of this great Office of <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Paſtor.</hi> When for the Sacrifice of the Maſs propitiatory for the living and the dead, they produce to us, as proof, from the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, theſe Texts: <hi>Melchizedeck offered bread and wine, they ſhall offer to my Name a pure ſacrifice from the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign wiſdom hath prepared her victuals, and mingled her wine. We have an Altar of which they have no right to partake, which ſerve the Tabernacle. Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> When, ſay I, they produce theſe paſſages for the intire proof of the Sacrifice of the Maſs, are you not tempted to believe they do not ſpeak in good earneſt? for nothing ſeems more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to ſound ſenſe. To prove that we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate Saints, they refer us to thoſe words of <hi>Jacob, The Angel which delivered me from all evil, keep the lads;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job, And to which of the Saints wilt thou turn thy ſelf?</hi> that is to ſay, of the Saints which are upon Earth; and thoſe of <hi>Daniel, Have mercy upon Iſrael, for the ſake of Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</hi> To prove that we muſt proſtrate our ſelves before Images, and worſhip Reliques, they produce thoſe words of God to <hi>Moſes, Pluck off thy ſhoes, for the place where thou ſtandeſt is holy ground;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>David, Worſhip before his footſtool;</hi> and thoſe of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, From thy childhood thou haſt learnt the holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="690" facs="tcp:49990:320"/>
Here is nothing to be laught at, 'tis that for which we ought to pour out tears of bloud, that Chriſtians ſhould fall into ſo prodigious a Stupidity, and into ſo great a want of Reaſon, that if the <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſhould fall into one like it, and would prove their Religion after this manner by their Alcoran, we ſhould take them for mad men. They ought not to tell you I diſſemble their principal proofs drawn from Scripture, for thoſe points whereof we ſpeak unto you, for they have no other, and the caſe is the ſame in all other Articles of Popery, without excepting their Faith concerning the Euchariſt. For theſe words, <hi>this is my Body,</hi> although they ſhould ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a real Preſence, do not ſignifie Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any means in the World. 'Tis a truth ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and many other Doctors after him, have confeſſed it. Is it not a ſhame, that on an Article ſo important as is the Adoration of the Sacrament, when they ſhould produce proofs from Scripture, they cannot produce ſo much as one, but theſe words, <hi>this is my Body;</hi> which do not ſpeak one word concerning Adoration. When they ought to prove the Power which is given to the Church to take away the Cup, again they quote, <hi>this is my Body.</hi> This is in propriety of ſpeech to mock men, being not willing to confeſs plainly that which is truth, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Religion hath no conformity to the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, that I may compleatly poſſeſs you of this truth, that Popery hath no kind of Bond, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or Conformity with the Scripture, obſerve theſe two things: <hi>First,</hi> That Popery treats the Scripture as a declared Enemy. It diſputes againſt its perfection, its clearneſs, its ſufficiency, and its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It makes vaſt Volumes to prove it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; that 'tis a Noſe of Wax, that 'tis a Sword with two edges, that it hath been an occaſion (by its
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:49990:320"/>obſcurity) of all Hereſies, that it contains not half the things that are neceſſary for ſalvation, that it hath no authority without the teſtimony of the Church, that it muſt be interpreted according to the Voice of the Church and her Practices, that ſhe contains a hundred things capable of raiſing ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and giving ſcandal. You have heard of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> who collected together all that ſeems ridiculous to the profane in the Scripture, as the Jaw-bone of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Aſs, and other like things to make it loſe its authority. They add, that the Scripture is maimed and half loſt, corrupted by the Jews or Hereticks, and as the top of all, the Popes, the Councils, the Doctors, the Inquiſitors, and the Parliaments, have even forbidden the reading of it to the People, as a dangerous Book. Is not this to declare themſelves, and to act as enemies to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? The other Reflection, which I wiſh you would make, is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> looks on the Scripture as her Enemy; Popery is always on its guard againſt the Holy Scripture, always prepared to give a Puſh, always drawing back and recoiling, always anſwering, always diſtinguiſhing; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſtinguiſhing Sacrifice into bloudy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy, ſometimes Adoration into <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> ſometimes the Head of the Church, into Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and Miniſterial, ſometimes the Eſſence of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt into natural and ſacramental, ſometimes Mediators, into Mediators of Interceſſion and of Redemption; always to repel the Scripture, and always to ſerve themſelves of it. Is it not therefore very clear that Popery is at a perfect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with the Scripture? It attacks it as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, by a hundred falſe Accuſations; it defends it ſelf againſt it as againſt an Enemy, by a hundred and a hundred imaginary diſtinctions to ward off the blows the Scripture gives it. To attack and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:49990:321"/>is all that Enemies do to one another. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well, my Brethren, in the Inſtructions which your Converters give you in theſe late times, the Scripture doth not enter among them. They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of the proof which their Doctors have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore drawn from the Scripture to ſupport their Doctrines. At this day they beat and preſs upon you by nothing but the pretended Authority of the Church, and Paſſages of the Fathers, which you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read.</p>
            <p>From all this I conclude, that Popery in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of true Religion, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in quality of the true Church, are by no means viſible, ſeeing they are deſtitute of that Light which alone can make the true Church viſible, <hi>viz.</hi> Conformity with the Holy Scripture.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, Containing A NARRATION OF THE WARS and SLAUGHTERS Occaſioned by the Jeſuits and Miſſionaries in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> FOR THE Promoting and Eſtabliſhing their Religion there: AND Some brief ACCOUNT OF THE Late Perſecution in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the precedent Age, <hi>James Alvarez,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> brought Letters from <hi>David</hi> the King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh: He found him at <hi>Bolonia</hi> with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and gave him thoſe Letters, which promiſed Obedience to him on the part of the King of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> This Promiſe of Homage coming from the South, was very acceptably
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:49990:324"/>received by <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh, who ſaw all the Weſt ready to revolt and ſhake off the Yoak of the Roman Church. The Letters of King <hi>David</hi> to the Pope (which are certainly very ſubmiſſive) are yet to be ſeen, but at preſent the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> pretend that <hi>James Alvarez</hi> was an Impoſtor and a Cheat, who falſified the Civilities of the Emperour, and interpreted his Letters wholly otherwiſe than they ſignified in the Original, becauſe Obedience to the Pope, and the Terms wherein they are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were utterly unknown in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> at that time. <hi>John Bermudes</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire aſſiſtance from the Pope againſt the Inhabitants of the Kingdom of <hi>Adel.</hi> The Pope received and treated him with great kindneſs, and furniſh'd the Abyſſines which were at <hi>Rome,</hi> with what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their entertainment, and to imprint Bibles and Littanies in their own Language. All theſe Civilities were ſo many Snares to make them fall by an intire ſubmiſſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige them to embrace the Romiſh Religion. <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Loyola,</hi> the Founder of the Order of Jeſuits, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſollicited a Commiſſion to go and labour in what they call the Converſion of this Great Empire. He could not obtain it, but it was given to <hi>John Barrett</hi> a Jeſuit, with the title of Patriarch of the Abyſſines. This <hi>Barrett</hi> took or received for a Companion <hi>Andrew Oviedo,</hi> with the title of Biſhop. They both embarqued in <hi>Portugal</hi> for the <hi>Indies,</hi> to the end that they might paſs from thence into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi> King <hi>Claudius</hi> had ſucceeded to <hi>David</hi> his Father. The Patriarch and his Suffragan Biſhop, would not venture themſelves with this new King, without knowing of what ſpirit and humour he was. They ſent three Jeſuits, <hi>James Dias, Goncal Rodrighes,</hi> and Friar <hi>Fulgentius Freyra,</hi> to get intelligence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him; they came and were received with
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:49990:324"/>ſufficient kindneſs by the King of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> But he learnt that the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſent him theſe men, and prepared others, to inſtruct him and his people in the Roman Religion; this affrighted him. He ſtood in doubt a long time betwixt the fear that he had, that theſe new Evangeliſts and Converters ſhould trouble both Church and State, and that of offending the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of whoſe friendſhip he thought he had need. He had divers Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with them, the ſum whereof on the part of the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> was, That if the Abyſſines would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they muſt acknowledge the Pope for the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſubmit to him under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Title. But the Abyſſines anſwered, That it was an Affair which could not be concluded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting the other Patriarchs. At laſt King <hi>Claudius</hi> permitted that the other Prieſts of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould come, and promiſed to receive them kindly. The Patriarch <hi>John Barrett</hi> nevertheleſs durſt not hazard his Patriarchal Dignity upon the Word of the King. He continued in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and ſent the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrew Oviedo,</hi> accompanied with five Prieſts of that Society. The King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> received them very civilly, and permitted them to perform Divine Offices according to the Roman Church; yea, it was permitted to all to joyn themſelves to the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viedo</hi> not content with that, was very importunate with the King to oblige him to ſubmit himſelf to the Pope. He anſwered, That his Anceſtors had never acknowledged other Superiour in holy things, than the Succeſſors of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> that is to ſay, the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This is worthy of obſervation, and makes it apparent, that <hi>Alvarez</hi> exceeded his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when he came to yield obedience and ſubmiſſion to the Pope, in the name of <hi>David</hi> the Father of <hi>Claudius.</hi> For the Son could not have ſaid, that his
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:49990:325"/>Anceſtors had never acknowledged any other than the Succeſſors of <hi>St. Mark,</hi> if very lately his Father had deſigned to ſubmit to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did actually do it. <hi>Oviedo</hi> preſſes the buſineſs, <hi>Claudias</hi> obſtinately refuſes. At laſt he conſented to Conferences, in which the Jeſuits had great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon the Abyſſines, becauſe they were very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. But King <hi>Claudias</hi> interpoſing therein, had almoſt as much advantage on the Miſſionaries of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as they had on the Eccleſiaſticks of <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> becauſe he was without compariſon the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of his Kingdom, as well in Divinity, as in the Art of Government. <hi>Oviedo</hi> ſeeing that he got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by theſe ways, reſolved to employ thoſe which were more violent. He left the Court to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his diſpleaſure, and publiſhed a Writing injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Abyſſine Church, in which he accuſed it of many Hereſies, and forbad the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> to have any Communion with it. The King was angry al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on his part, but a little while after he was ſlain in a Battel, and left his Brother <hi>Adamus Saghed</hi> Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to his Realm. This Prince uſed more rigour againſt <hi>Oviedo,</hi> and his Companions; he revoked all thoſe Acts of Grace which his Predeceſſors had granted to them. He forbad them, upon pain of death, to trouble his Eſtates by their new Goſpel. The Biſhop withdrew to <hi>Fremone</hi> upon the Frontiers of the Kingdom, and there abode thirty years with the <hi>Portugeſe,</hi> under the Title of the Patriarch of the Abyſſines, which he took after the death of <hi>John Barrett. Adam Saghed</hi> died, and his Son <hi>Malec Sag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed</hi> ſucceeded him. He treated the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> more kindly; and they being reformed by the correction they had received, acted more wiſely, and with greater moderation. Nevertheleſs, this Miſſion was extinct, becauſe they had no way of ſending Succeſſors, the <hi>Turks</hi> having poſſeſſed the Ports of
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:49990:325"/>the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> which gave admiſſion into <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> And the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> which would have converted all the Nation, were found without Prieſts to give them the Communion.</p>
            <p>But in the beginning of this Age, in the year 1604. a Jeſuit named <hi>Peter Pais,</hi> was more happy than all thoſe who had preceded them. He entered into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and made himſelf admired by an Ability, which although it were but very indifferent, ſeemed extraordinary among people which knew nothing. He came to the Court of <hi>Zadengel,</hi> who was then King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and managed him ſo well, that he obtained an expreſs Promiſe from him, that he would ſubmit to the Pope and the Religion of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This Prince began with an Ordinance which forbad the obſervation of <hi>Saturday,</hi> or the Sabbath, which the Abyſſines venerate as the Lord's Day. The Great Men of the Realm being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by this Enterprize, conſpired againſt him, and ſlew him, after a Battel, in which he was not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. Behold already the death of one King which <hi>Papery</hi> cauſed in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> This death coſt the Jeſuit Converters nothing; on the contrary they found in <hi>Suſneus,</hi> the Succeſſor of <hi>Zadengel,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector much more proper to make the Miniſter of their Violence. <hi>Suſneus</hi> permitted himſelf to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by theſe Miſſionaries of <hi>Portugal</hi> in ſuch a manner, that they prevailed with him to declare openly, that he would change the Religion of the Country, and ſubmit the Abyſſine Church to the Pope. He wrote concerning it to <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, and to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was then alſo King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> Many Great Lords of the Court, and Officers of the Army, out of complaiſance to their King, embraced the Religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and communicated with them. <hi>Suſneus</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many kind Letters from <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, writ
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:49990:326"/>to him again another Letter dated the 31th of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> 1613. by which he acknowledges him for Paſtor of the Univerſal Church, and deſires his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to confirm his Religion. This Prince, guided by the Jeſuits, to the end that they might do things a little in form, cauſed many Conferences to be held upon the Queſtion of the two Natures in Chriſt Jeſus. For the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> following the Schiſm of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> acknowledge in him but one. But the truth is, there is at this day nothing but a diſpute of words thereon: for the <hi>Eutychians</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Divinity and Humanity in Chriſt Jeſus, but it pleaſes them to ſay, this Union makes but one Nature compounded of two, as the Body and Soul in Man make but one Compound; ſo that 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that we may very well give our ſelves indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence therein, but 'tis not of the <hi>Spirit of Popery</hi> to tollerate any thing. The King at the ſollicitations of the Jeſuits, made an Edict, by which he ordained, That henceforward they ſhould believe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt Jeſus. The Abyſſine Monks which fell in the Diſpute, ſuſtained themſelves in their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance with obſtinacy in their Opinion; but one of them having ſpoken a little too freely, was brought before the King, and was beaten with a ſtirrup-leather. Behold the <hi>Spirit of Popery,</hi> which began to diſcover it ſelf without diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>This firſt Violence awakened their ſleeping Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Simeon</hi> the Metropolitan of the Abyſſines came to Court; he complains, That without conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, they had done ſuch things upon Religion. The King anſwered, That for his ſatisfaction there ſhould yet be a Conference on that ſubject. The conſequence was, that after the Conference the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits obtained an Edict, by which it was forbidden, on pain of death, to ſay there was but one Nature in Chriſt Jeſus. This frightful Decree was a clap of
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:49990:326"/>Thunder which ſeemed to reduce the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Abyſſines into powder; and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> knew then by experience what Evils the <hi>Spirit of Popery</hi> drew along with it; all the Realm was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, and the moſt moderate loſt their modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſidered that in truth the Controverſie about two Natures in Chriſt, in the eſtate in which now it was, was of no importance, but that ſuch a ſeverity was unheard of in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> ſince the times of the Apoſtles; and that it was wholly oppoſite to the nature of the Chriſtian Religion, for which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they concluded they muſt not ſuffer ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Jamanaxus,</hi> Brother by the Mothers ſide of the Emperour, puts himſelf at the head of a very powerful Confederation, into which many great Lords entered, with all the Church-men, and a great part of the People.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan <hi>Simeon,</hi> who ſtrove leſs againſt the two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt, than for his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which they would have taken from him, in favour of him whom it ſhould pleaſe the <hi>Pope</hi> to name) excommunicated all thoſe which followed the Religion of the <hi>Franks,</hi> for ſo they call the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Romans.</hi> This boldneſs cauſed ſome fear to the Emperour; he grew a little moderate, and made another Edict, in which he gave Liberty of Conſcience to all his Subjects; and in all appearance he had continued ſo to do, if he had followed his own Inclinations. But at the inſtigation of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits he returned to more violent Counſels. The Queen-Mother, the Metropolitan, the Church-men, and the Monks, threw themſelves at his feet in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the ancient Religion; but he rejected them all with violence, ſo that there was no more hopes of Peace. <hi>Jamanaxus</hi> the King's Brother, <hi>Elias</hi> his Son-in-Law, Governour of the Province of <hi>Tygris,</hi> with a great Party, reſolved to oppoſe the Violence
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:49990:327"/>by force. The Metropolitan renews his Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; the Sword-men take Arms: <hi>Aelius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all the <hi>Portugeſe</hi> to go out of the Province whereof he was Governour; they came to blows. The Party of the King and the Jeſuits, was the ſtronger. <hi>Aelius</hi> was ſlain. <hi>Simeon</hi> the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan was taken, whom they beheaded: they made a great Butchery among the People; but <hi>Jamanaxus</hi> was pardoned. Behold already how much Bloud hath been ſhed by <hi>Popery.</hi>

            <p>But things will not continue there. The Jeſuits and their King, puft up with the ſucceſs of their Victory, proceed to a new Reformation. The Prince forbad them the obſervation of the <hi>Saturday</hi>-Sabbath, and commanded, that they ſhould labour on that day, upon the penalty of confiſcating their Goods for the ſecond Offence. 'Tis indeed an affair ſufficiently ſmall, about which it were very poſſible to have given a tolleration; but <hi>Popery</hi> underſtands not the meaning of that word: they ſeverely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed, for an Example, one named <hi>Buc,</hi> a perſon very eminent in the Kingdom for his Military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. This new ſeverity gave occaſion of a revolt to one named <hi>Jonael</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Bageindra.</hi> All the Court, the women, and the Favourites in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed in this affair, a little to ſoften and bend the Spirit of the King, but the Jeſuits prevailed upon him. He would not comply with their Perſwaſions. So they came a ſecond time to war; <hi>Jonael</hi> was beaten many times, and withdrew from the Kingdom. This did not affright others. Thoſe of the Province of <hi>Damos</hi> took Arms for the ancient Religion. The Hermites, which are there in great abundance, were willing to ſignalize themſelves in this Holy War. Nevertheleſs, their Party was beaten; but there was great effuſion of Bloud on both ſides.</p>

Behold the ordinary Methods by which <hi>Popery</hi> arrives at Empire: After theſe repeated Victories which coſt the King of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> great part of his Subjects, he accompliſhed his deſign. The Jeſuites by his Authority intirely overturned the Religion and Church of the <hi>Abyſſines;</hi> all gave way either to ſeduction or violence. They ſwore Fidelity and Obedience to <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth; the <hi>Pope</hi> ſent there a <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch; all thoſe who would not obey were ſeverely chaſtiſed. The new Patriarch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Kingdom, baptizing and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infinite number of perſons. They eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seminaries of the Children of the <hi>Abyſſines,</hi> and <hi>Portugueſe.</hi> In one word, <hi>Popery</hi> by its ordinary ways which are violence, and the ſword, became maſter of all <hi>Abyſſinia.</hi> One named <hi>Tecla Georgius,</hi> another Son-in-law of the King, put himſelf at the head of the Malecontents, which were in great number, but the fortune of the Jeſuites did yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the King in this Affair; <hi>Tecla Georgius</hi> was ſlain, and his Siſter hanged on a Tree, becauſe ſhe had ſpoken a little too freely againſt the Rites of the <hi>Latine Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Patriarch <hi>Alphonſus Mendez,</hi> a Jeſuit, knew not how to uſe his good Fortune, but believing that henceforward he might abandon himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraint, to that ſpirit of Tyranny which hath its ſeat at <hi>Rome,</hi> ill intreated all the great Men of the Court, excommunicated the prime Officers of the Kingdom, for things which were not Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical: he domineer'd over all with ſo much inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that at length the King himſelf, and all the Courtiers opened their eyes upon the conduct of theſe new Tyrants. Rebellions were renewed in moſt part of the Provinces; Battels were fought, and blood ſpilt under the Authority of the King,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:49990:328"/>who was ſtill abuſed by Popery. But a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called <hi>Ras Seelax,</hi> a great Favourite of the King's, and a great Protecter of Popery, having loſt his Reputation, the Affairs of the Jeſuites, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſunk, and fell into decay thereby. The King being tired by the Troubles which theſe new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts brought to him every day by their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours, and ſeeing that the <hi>Hydra</hi> of Rebellion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it loſt one head found a hundred, began very much to abate of his rigour, and granted liberty to whoſoever would uſe it, to preſerve, and obſerve the ancient Religion. This goodneſs of the Prince which agreed very well with natural Equity, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed theſe imperious Maſters; they made violent oppoſition thereunto; but favour continued no longer on their ſide, the ſame Prince which had aboliſhed the ancient Religion, doth re-eſtabliſh it, or rather permits that it ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed after ten or twelve years interruption. <hi>Suſneus</hi> dies a little while after. This Protector of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on newly eſtabliſhed, being dead, Popery tumbled with haſte and violence towards ruine. They repaid to the Jeſuites the cruelty they had uſed; they took away their Churches, and Goods, and drove them out of the Kingdom. They tried all ways, they ſet their Friends and Creatures on work; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, they deſired the help of Arms, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers from <hi>Goa,</hi> for their Defence, but all to no purpoſe. The Patriarch <hi>Alphonſus Mendez,</hi> was put into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> from whence he was redeemed with Money: but his Companions the Jeſuites <hi>Almeyda,</hi> Father <hi>Hyacynthus, Lewis Cardyra,</hi> and many others were hanged as Diſturbers of the publick Peace. The <hi>Congregation for the Propagation of Faith,</hi> were willing to attempt the Recovery of this brave Kingdom, which they had loſt: they
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:49990:328"/>ſend ſix <hi>Capuchines</hi> to try if they could paſs once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> but two of them died by the hand of the <hi>Cafres,</hi> two were ſtoned in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> the other two returned without doing any thing. In concluſion, three other <hi>Capuchines</hi> were willing to make another attempt: they came aſhore at <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aquene,</hi> a Port of the Red-ſea, poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks;</hi> from thence they wrote to the King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> (as if it had been a thing grateful to him) that they were there ready to paſs into his Country, as ſoon as he ſhould furniſh them with neceſſary Accommodations. For anſwer, <hi>Baſilides,</hi> who was then King of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> after his Father <hi>Suſneus,</hi> writ to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Baſſa who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the place, that he would do him the kindneſs to ſend him the Heads of thoſe three <hi>Franks.</hi> This was done, they cut off their heads, they flead off their skins, which they filled with Hay, and ſent them to <hi>Baſilides.</hi> So theſe poor miſerable Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es bore the puniſhment of all the Blood which the Jeſuites, and Popery had ſhed in the Kingdom of the <hi>Abyſſines.</hi> This Hiſtory, as it ſeems to me, is very proper to ſhew, that in all places, as well as in all Ages, the ſpirit of Popery is the occaſion of Trouble, Confuſion, Tyranny, and Perſecution; and God did permit that Popery ſhould proſecute its uſual methods in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> as elſewhere, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Abyſſine</hi> Church from continuing under the Papal Tyranny. For if theſe Emiſſaries of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had proceeded with more Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſpared Blood, and offered no Violence to the Conſciences of men, without doubt Popery had this day been regnant among the <hi>Abyſſines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Liberty of the Reformed Churches of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> was eſtabliſhed upon very good Foundations:
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:49990:329"/>the Kings of that Country had granted to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants divers Declarations, by which the exerciſe of the Reformed Religion was permitted in all places. On the year 1606, was made the Treaty called the <hi>Pacification</hi> between <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Emperour, and King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Stephen Bothskey Kis-ma-ria:</hi> The firſt Article whereof grants, That the Reformed <hi>Hungarians</hi> ſhould not in any thing be troubled in the exerciſe of their Religion, and that all the Churches taken from them during the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſhould be reſtored to them. All the Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> which have been ſince <hi>Matthias, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the Second, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, have confirmed theſe Priviledges by their Declarations: To conclude, the preſent Emperour in the year 1655, when he was crowned King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> confirmed by an expreſs Declaration, all that his Predeceſſours had done. The eleventh Article of that Declaration concedes, <hi>That for the Conſervation of Peace amongst all the Orders and States of</hi> Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>the buſineſs of Religion ſhall remain free without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any Diſturbance, according to the Conſtitution of</hi> Vienna, <hi>and the Articles publiſhed before the Coronation; in ſuch ſort that the exerciſe of Religion ſhall be entirely free for the Barons, Lords, Nobles, free Citizens, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for all Eſtates and Orders of</hi> Hungary, <hi>as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the Towns and Villages which will embrace it; ſo that no perſon of what eſtate or condition ſoever, may be hindered by his Majeſty, or other Temporal Lords in any manner, or under any pretence whatſoever, from the free uſe and exerciſe of the ſaid Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Things were in this eſtate in the year 1671, when a Jeſuite named <hi>George Barze,</hi> Titular Biſhop of <hi>Warradine,</hi> calling himſelf Counſellour to his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majeſty, publiſhed a Book with this Title, <hi>Truth declared to all the World, which makes it appear
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:49990:329"/>by three Arguments, that his Imperial Majeſty is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to Tollerate the</hi> Lutheran, <hi>and</hi> Calviniſt <hi>Sect in</hi> Hungary. It is eaſie to underſtand what a Work of this Title, that has a Jeſuite for its Author, doth contain: The deſign thereof was to juſtifie the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions which had been already made againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> as well as thoſe they were preparing to make: For already, a long time before the publication of this Writing, ſome particular Lords had ſet up for cruel Perſecutors. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Francis Nadaſti, Paul Eſtherſiazy,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, at the inſtigation of the Prieſts and Jeſuites, had employed both fire and ſword: they had maſſacred the Reformed in their Churches, hanged them up on the bars of their Church-doors, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they had thrown head-long from Turrets. The Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and Popiſh Gentlemen had thus uſed them, and alſo pulled down the Churches in the Countries which held, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them. The free Cities, and thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only on the Emperour, were exempt from this ſtorm; but they ſhall have their turn on the occaſion following.</p>
            <p>Many great <hi>Hungarian</hi> Lords of the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the <hi>Nadaſties,</hi> the <hi>Serinies,</hi> the <hi>Frangipanes,</hi> joyn themſelves to <hi>Francis Rakotſqui,</hi> and took Arms againſt the Emperour for private Quarrels. The Troops of <hi>Auſtria</hi> on this occaſion entred into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> on the year 1670, and defeated theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. The Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and Jeſuites of <hi>Hungary,</hi> thought they muſt not let ſlip the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities they now had to perſecute the Proteſtants. They ſerved themſelves of theſe inſolent &amp; victorious Troops in all the free Cities, to do the ſame Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences which had been done by particular Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Reformed. Without form of Proceſs
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:49990:330"/>they took away their Churches, they baniſhed the Miniſters, they put them in Priſon, they maſſacred a great number, they charged the People, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Nobility with Taxes, Souldiers, and Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; they offered a thouſand and a thouſand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olences to oblige people to change their Religion. All the Eccleſiaſticks every one by himſelf acted like unbridled Furies. The Priſons were filled with theſe miſerable Wretches; the Churches were raz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every-where; in the moſt places there were horrible Maſſacres, and even whole Villages burnt, becauſe they were wholly inhabited by Proteſtants; they hung the Miniſters at the Doors of their Churches: There was one named <hi>John Baki,</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Church of <hi>Comana,</hi> who was burnt. At <hi>Caſſovia</hi> and <hi>Poſonium</hi> they put to death a great number of perſons of all Sexes, of all Ages, and all Qualities: They baniſhed all thoſe whom they dare not kill. In one word, all <hi>Hungary</hi> became a place like Hell for the Reformed, where death, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and torments preſented themſelves every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where before their eyes.</p>
            <p>To give ſome colour of Juſtice to theſe Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, they eſtabliſhed a Chamber at <hi>Poſonium,</hi> made up of all ſuch as were found moſt cruel E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the Proteſtants: They ſummon'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before they ſummon'd their Paſtors, hoping that they would fall the more eaſily by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and that fear would cauſe them to change their Religion; thoſe which appeared, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themſelves on their innocency, were caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſons, oppreſſed with Fines, perſecuted after a hundred manners, and conſtrained at laſt to change their Religion. To thoſe which had courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough not to renounce the Truth, they preſented a Writing to be ſubſcribed, by which they made
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:49990:330"/>them promiſe they would forſake their Paſtors, that they would not protect them, and that they would not oppoſe the Prieſts in taking poſſeſſion of their Churches: On which Condition they promiſed to let them live in peace, in hope and expectation that the Spirit would enlighten and Convert them. Some fell, and made their ſubſcriptions, others pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed through miſery, famine, and torments in the priſons. When they had thus ſubdued and abuſed the people, they turn themſelves to their Paſtors; they eſtabliſhed three Chambers of Juſtice, the one at <hi>Tinew,</hi> and two at <hi>Poſonium,</hi> before whom they ſummoned at firſt a ſmall number of Paſtors of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburgh.</hi> They appeared to the number of thirty two, or thirty three, the 25th of <hi>September,</hi> 1673; they preſented them a Writing to be ſubſcribed, importing, That it was their will and pleaſure, that they ſhould ſay, that to eſcape the ſentence which might be pronounced againſt them for their Rebellion, they did conſent to one of theſe three things: Either to Renounce all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Office for ever, and to live as good Subjects privately in the Realm; or to go volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily into Exile, with promiſe never to return again into the Eſtates of the Emperour; or to embrace the Catholick Religion, in which caſe they might remain in the Kingdom, and enjoy all ſorts of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages there. The providence of God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this unjuſt, and altogether unrighteous proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, to the end that theſe poor accuſed perſons might have an opportunity to juſtifie themſelves from the Crime of Rebellion, whereof they were accuſed. Is it ſo that men uſed to proceed againſt thoſe that are Traytors? And has it been uſual to puniſh them with a voluntary Exile, or by a ſimple Renunciation of their Offices, and Charges?
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:49990:331"/>They did all that they could to oblige the Paſtors to ſubſcribe this Writing; and the moſt part of them fearing death, did ſubſcribe, confeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves culpable, though they were innocent, and went voluntarily into Baniſhment.</p>

               <hi>Section.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This attempt having ſucceed ſufficiently well to the Perſecutors, the year following, in the Month of <hi>February</hi> 1674, they ſummon'd before their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals generally all Miniſters, Regents, Profeſſors, and Maſters of Schools, of the Reformed Religion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> as well thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> as thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> part of them refuſe to appear, others fled, and others tarried at home, under the protection of their Lords, who were <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there were to the number of two hundred and fifty which had the courage to appear at the day appointed. Theſe were they which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be the Objects of the moſt cruel Rage that ever was exerciſed. Of theſe two hundred and fifty, they choſe out ſix to anſwer in the name of all, to the Accuſation which was thus formed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: <hi>That renouncing the fear of God, and Men, they had accuſed all the Members of the Catholick Kingdom of</hi> Hungary, <hi>and by conſequence the King himſelf, of being Idolaters; that they had ſpoken inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in their Sermons againſt the Bleſſed Virgin, the Saints departed, and againſt their Images, and thoſe of Jeſus Christ; that they had violated the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity made to their Prince; given Succours to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, opened the way to the</hi> Turks, <hi>to the end they might poſſeſs themſelves of the Kingdom of</hi> Hungary,
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:49990:331"/>
               <hi>and by conſequence, that they were guilty of Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> GOD, <hi>and Man, and worthy to loſe both their Goods and Lives.</hi> The firſt part of the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an Affair purely of Religion, and 'twas that alone for which theſe poor afflicted perſons ſuffered Perſecution. For the fault of Rebellion, there was not the leaſt ground to ſuſpect them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; their Judges themſelves juſtified them therein, and <hi>Forgatz</hi> the Preſident of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſaid to ſome that did ſollicite him, <hi>In the Name of God trouble me no more; for before God, I myſelf am in no ſecurity, for if I ſpeak but one word on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, they will accuſe me of Rebellion, and caſt me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Priſon.</hi> But in truth they were ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of the puniſhments which theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Crimes deſerved, and whereof they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, provided they would ſign the Writing which others had ſigned, confeſs themſelves guilty, and go into voluntary Exile: Yea, they offered to give them Money to conduct them whitherſoever they would go. There is a great deal of probability, that perſons who had cauſed the <hi>Turk</hi> to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, ſhould be permitted to quit it by a voluntary Baniſhment: Moreover, this Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeems ſo abſurd, that I can ſee no reaſon why they ſhould chooſe it for a pretence. 'Tis a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Wickedneſs to determine Baniſhment to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only for Religion, and yet make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a Fault of which every one knows they were innocent, to the end they might have opportunity to ſay, that they were puniſhed for a Crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State. 'Tis the Spirit that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reigned among Perſecutors. The <hi>Pagans</hi> made the Chriſtians ſuffer horrible puniſhments only for their Faith: Nevertheleſs, to deprive them of the glory of Martyrdom, they would make them confeſs theſe enormous Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were accuſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="642" facs="tcp:49990:332"/>
On this pretended Crime, or to ſpeak better, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the refuſal of theſe <hi>Hungarian</hi> Paſtors to quit their Miniſtery, their Churches, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, on the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> 1674, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye. And happy had they been if the Sentence had been executed upon them, ſince ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were Martyrs and Confeſſors under the firſt ten Perſecutions of the <hi>Pagans</hi> expoſed to ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el tryals and temptations. <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Colonitſch,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> the Jeſuite <hi>Nicholas Kellion</hi> (Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of barbarity and cruelty) were the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of thoſe horrible torments which they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe glorious-Confeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, whereof we ſhall give you a very ſhort A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement: They had no deſign to put them to death, according to the ſentence pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; that had been to deliver them too ſoon, and it 'twas in their deſign to make them paſs through a thouſand deaths ſucceſſively. Some of them they put into Irons, giving liberty to others, thereby to oblige them to renounce the truth, through fear of the Chaſtiſement which they ſaw fall upon their Companions. For the ſpace of eight whole Weeks they employed all ſorts of Artifice to get them to ſign the Writing, and to go voluntarily into Baniſhment, confeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty. But ſeeing they encouraged each other to bear the tryal, they ſeparated them, and put the Miniſters of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburgh</hi> by themſelves. Many fell, ſubſcribed, confeſſed themſelves guilty, and went into Exile. There was forty ſix which refuſed, and were caſt into priſons: and a few hours after they fetched them thence, and tranſported them, ſome by Waggon, and ſome by the <hi>Danube,</hi> into divers Fortreſſes of the Kingdom: They carried twenty to <hi>Comarine,</hi> eight to <hi>Sawarine,</hi> eight to <hi>Berenſtchine,</hi> and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:49990:332"/>to <hi>Leopolſtadt;</hi> all of them laden with Chains and Irons. They gave for Conductor to thoſe nineteen carried to <hi>Leopol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> a Hangman, which carrying Halters in his hand through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Journey, threatned to hang them on the firſt Gibbet, if they did not yield to what he demanded of them. The Reformed Paſtors of the Confeſſion of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> had more courage than the moſt part of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Paſtors; for except two, they all reſolv'd to ſuffer all things, rather than ſign that Writing, by which it was intended they ſhould ſully their innocence by confeſſing a pretended Rebellion, and that they ſhould renounce their Miniſtry. Upon their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal they diſtributed them (as the others) to divers Cittadels of the Kingdom. They carried ſeven of them to <hi>Sawarine,</hi> as many to <hi>Kapuwarin,</hi> ſix to <hi>Eberard</hi>-Caſtle, and the twenty one that remain were ſent to <hi>Leopolſtadt:</hi> they were all chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put into deep and dark Dungeons. In all theſe places they received unheard of Treatments, thoſe which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Berentſchin</hi> were coupled two and two, as they yoke Oxen. They put Irons on their feet, all filled with Nails which paſſed through their ſhoes and ſtockings, and pierced their very fleſh. The Priſon where they were put was as dark as Hell, 'twas a low ſtinking Dungeon, full of Excrements, Mud, Man's Dung, Serpents and Toads, into which they could not enter, but on their hands and knees. The Governour of the Cittadel having repreſented to <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitſch</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Newſtadt,</hi> that theſe Priſoners had not ſtrength enough to ſuffer ſuch torment, and that they would die under it; <hi>'Tis no matter,</hi> ſaid the Biſhop, <hi>when they be dead, earth enough will be found in the Fields to cover them.</hi> They took them not thence, but to make them carry Wood for the uſe of the Cittadel, and to draw Water from a deep Well. Of thoſe which had been conducted to <hi>Comorin,</hi> the moſt part having ſuffered the moſt horrible Priſon during the ſpace of many months, were ſo weak as to ſuffer themſelves to be overcome, and abandon their Confeſſion. There were not in this place above three Confeſſors that perſevered, whom they cauſed to ſerve in all thoſe painful works, in which they employed Turkiſh Slaves.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Eberard,</hi> eighty years old, full of fire and rage in that age which naturally is of Ice, took the pains to beat with blows by a Mallet, thoſe which had been brought into the fortreſs of that place, and he had bruiſed and broken
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:49990:333"/>their limbs in ſuch ſort, that the moſt part of them were not able to move themſelves. Others were employed in cruel labours under which he took pleaſure to ſee them ſweat even to Bloud. But nothing is like to that which thirty nine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors ſuffered; ſeventeen of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> and twenty two of the Confeſſion of <hi>Swiſs,</hi> which were conducted to <hi>Leopolſtadt.</hi> There were three which abandoned the Truth, being overcome by the length and cruelty of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. The reſt were given up to the rage of the Jeſuit <hi>Nicholas Kellion,</hi> the moſt cruel of all the Monſters of <hi>Lybia.</hi> Theſe poor men proteſting their innocency before him one day; he ſaid to them, <hi>I do indeed believe that the moſt part of you are not guilty of Rebellion againſt the King, but you deſerve all ſorts of Puniſhments for your Rebellion againſt the Church.</hi> This wicked Wretch takes them not from their dark Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make them labour at thoſe Employments which had killed the ſtrongeſt men, to carry horrible burthens, to remove Earth, and to make Fortifications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Cittadel. And becauſe thoſe Martyrs (to whom they did not give of coarſe black Bread a quarter ſo much as was neceſſary to nouriſh them, and almoſt no Water) could not lift up their hands, nor ſet one foot before another, he cauſed them to be beaten by blows with rods, with ſtaves, with the butt-end of Muskets, and with cords moiſtned, and full of knots. After theſe horrible pains, he caſt them into a dark Dungeon, where lying among Rats, Serpents, and Toads, they were not able to reſt one moment. So that 'tis unconceivable how Bodies ſo waſted, could be able to endure ſuch long Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If any one toucht with compaſſion, did endeavour to give any refreſhment to theſe Confeſſors, they puniſht them ſeverely. A certain Perſon attempting to give ſome Onyons to one of them, the Jeſuit cauſed both him that gave them, and him that received them, to be torn with the blows of a Whip, by the hand of a Hangman. And becauſe a certain Woman had given them a little Bread, and ſome other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſhe was dragged through the City, put in the Pillory, and treated as they do publick Whores. They gave them neither Shoes nor Cloaths, inſomuch that they went barefoot, and ſcarce had they rags enough upon their Bodies, to cover their more ſhameful parts: Upon the leaſt and ſmalleſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they ſaw a Hangman come into their Dungeon, who beat them with Rods till the Blood came. We cannot expreſs
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:49990:333"/>the horrible Violences that were done unto them, to oblige them to adore the Hoſt; they dragg'd them becauſe they would not go. On Feaſt-days, and on the Sabbaths, the Jeſuit <hi>Kellio</hi> came with a Troop of Soldiers, who with kicks of his foot, blows with the Musket and wooden Bars, puſht forward theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures to their Churches; inſomuch, that they made them at one blow to leap a great heighth into the Air; they fell back upon the Pavement bruiſed and broken; and when they could not go, they dragg'd them on the ground, which they ſtained and tinctured with their Blood. The Jeſuits one day beat two of theſe venerable old Men to that exceſs, that they dyed a little after. This Monſter perceiving well that his Cruelties would do him injury, even amongſt thoſe of his own Party, towards the end of his Commiſſion, thought it adviſable to treat them a little more kindly, and afterwards by violence, threatnings, and evil treatments, he drew from them a Teſtimonial, by which they acknowledged that Father <hi>Kellio</hi> had permitted the Mony which was ſent them by their Friends to be given to them: That he had ſuffered them to eat the Proviſions alſo which were ſent them; yea, that he had granted liberty to their Friends, and Neighbours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them. And this vile Villain having formed this Confeſſion and Teſtimony after his own pleaſure, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately made it publick, that he might diſſipate the Reports which had been ſpread abroad concerning his Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs this was not the end of the Troubles, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of theſe Confeſſors: They were condemn'd to be ſent to the Gallies in <hi>Spain;</hi> and on the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> 1675. they were delivered to ſome Companies of Soldiers that had been raiſed in <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and to the 36 which had been taken from <hi>Leopoldſtadt,</hi> they joyned five others, who had been brought from <hi>Brenchſtin.</hi> We cannot expreſs the Barbarities exerciſed againſt theſe forty Confeſſors: They were to travel thoſe long diſtances which are from <hi>Hungary</hi> to the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, on foot, (there Feet being laden with heavy Irons) croſs the Sands, the Rocks, Mountains, and the Stones, beaten with Cudgels, and Bulls-piſles; their Feet did crack, and were wounded, and you might follow them every-where by the tract of their own Blood, which fell from all parts of their Bodies. When they came to <hi>Tergeſte,</hi> they were in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they could go no further with their Irons; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a neceſſity that they muſt be broken off from
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:49990:334"/>their feet, and this was not done without covering their feet with bloudy wounds, and taking away ſome pieces of their Fleſh. They gave them not above twelve Ounces of coarſe Bread by the day to live on. Judge you if that could ſupport theſe miſerable Creatures in ſo tedious a travel. At night they lodged them in Stables like Dogs, where they could find no reſt. If there was any one not able to go, whom they were forced to ſet on Horſeback, when the Beaſt did not go, they beat him that ſat thereon with great blows of Cudgels and Whips: At <hi>Theate</hi> there remained ſix, four whereof died of theſe horrible Journeys, the two other were tranſported to <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they were arrived there, they would have conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be liſted in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, which they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: they ſold them to Maſters of the Gallies of <hi>Naples,</hi> at the price of 50 <hi>Rix Dollers</hi> a piece. Theſe poor miſerable Paſtors treated as they had been, were in no condition to do any Service in the Gallies; for which reaſon thoſe which had bought them, made no haſt to pay for them; whereupon the <hi>German</hi> Captains reſolved to kill all theſe Gally-ſlaves; but the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> hindered them. They were nine Months in theſe Gallies, where they ſuffered all the Evils, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and Outrages that can be imagined, At laſt God ſent them, as by a Miracle, Mr. <hi>Ruyter</hi> the <hi>Holland</hi> Admiral, who reſcued them from theſe horrible Miſeries. Theſe are the Adventures of thoſe Paſtors that had been Impriſoned at <hi>Leopoldſtadt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were yet twenty in the Priſons of <hi>Sarwar, Capuwar, Tergeſte</hi> and <hi>Buccari</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> who were treated as thoſe of whom we have ſpoken. They cauſed them to go down into Caves full of Dirt, Toads, Serpents, Excrements, that had been long heaped together. At length, after they had paſſed through a ſucceſſion of Cruelties, whereof <hi>Phalaris</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was never guilty, on the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1675, they were ordered, as others, to be ſent to the Gallies, in hopes that ſome-body would buy them; for the Vice-Roy, and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> abſolutely refuſed to buy thoſe miſerable Creatures, who on the one ſide were innocent, and on the other were incapable of doing any Service, by reaſon of the Afflictions that they made them ſuffer.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, of <hi>Newſtadt</hi> that famous Perſecutor, put them under the conduct of one of his Hangmen, and cauſed them to
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:49990:334"/>be conveyed to <hi>Tergeſte,</hi> a City ſcituated on the Borders of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea: There they ſhut them up in a Stable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one of them eſcaped, they cruelly ſcourged all the reſt. The Fugitive being purſued and taken, they forced all the reſt to whip their Companion twice a day. Not content to ſatisfie their Rage on theſe unhappy perſons, they would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their Avarice alſo, they treated with them for their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at a great ſum of Money, which they received, and then delivered but two men. In the month of <hi>October</hi> in the ſame year, they carried them from <hi>Tergeſte</hi> to <hi>Buccari,</hi> to put them on the Gallies of <hi>Malta:</hi> While they expected, the coming of the Gallies, they put them in a Vault which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Priſon, where Ordure, Filth, Urine, and the Waters of the Priſon ran; there they caſt unto them, by a hole, ſome morſels of Bread, which they went on hands and feet to gather up in the midſt of Man's Dung. They faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them with Chains which came under their Throats, and held the Chin raiſed up, that they could not incline it downward. They put Irons on their feet, and they were bound croſs their bodies with Irons beſides. They were thirty nine days in this poſture, and ſometimes they carried them out into the Street to make them a Spectacle to the People. Thoſe who had endured a great many horrible Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, fell under theſe. Ten of them ſigned the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting which had been required of them at firſt, and that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription having done nothing towards their deliverance, they abjured their Religion ſome time after, being forced thereto by the length of their Torments. Two of thoſe which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevered, died on the ſeventh of <hi>December,</hi> and their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions buried them in the Sand on the Sea-ſhore, having ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with their hands to make Graves for them. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but ſix of thoſe which were caſt into this horrible Priſon. The one of theſe ſix being in an Agony on the Sand of the Sea, after ſo many ſufferings, and being in no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himſelf to return to Priſon, was drag'd by the Serjeants with ſo much violence upon the Stones and Stairs of the Vault, that in all places where his Body paſſed, there was left of the Bloud, and pieces of the Fleſh of this poor Sufferer, who died within a few hours after, and remained without burial in the ſtinking Sink. They told the other five, that they were appointed to die in the ſame place of Dung, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Corruption, if they did not abjure their Religion.
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:49990:335"/>God fortified them in theſe their laſt Combats, in which they continued till the month of <hi>May</hi> 1676. at which time God ſent them for a Deliverer the Embaſſadour of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> who demanded them, and they were granted to him. When they drew them from their Cave, they had no humane ſhape; their Throats were putrified their Teeth were fallen out, and they could not endure any Meat in their Mouths, without feeling very ſharp and pungent pains. They put them in good Beds; two famous Popiſh Phyſicians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook their recovery; one of the five died at <hi>Venice</hi> the 24th of <hi>May;</hi> the four others eſcaped by Miracle, and came into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Heydekker</hi> ſays, that he ſaw with horror upon their Bodies the glorious Marks of their long Confeſſion: ſo that 'tis from themſelves that he learnt the Hiſtory of their Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>I am very much perſwaded that there are no honeſt Men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> itſelf, which do not tremble at ſuch a Report; and I am unwilling to charge theſe Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, with the infamy of ſuch Cruelties, which are not guilty of it, nor capable of committing it. But this does not hinder, but that we may ſee therein the Spirit of Popery. Behold what the Prieſts and Monks are capable of, in whom this Spirit does properly reſide. 'Tis the Spirit of Murder, and Falſhood; and therefore 'tis the Spirit of the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If this be not a powerful Prejudice againſt Popery, I think there can be none. Let a Man look on Popery with its Cords, Whips, Gibbets, its Racks, its Wheels, its Fires, and Flames, ſnarling and threatning like the Devil, to tear Bodies, ſhed Bloud, torture Souls, extend Sufferers upon Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tying them to Poſts, and caſting them into Flames: Let a Man behold it, I ſay, in this frightful Dreſs, and horrible Employment, and let him tell me, if he finds any thing like it, in the Character of the Chriſtian Religion. How can a Man fail to find therein the <hi>Babylon</hi> of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which makes herſelf drunk with the Blood of the Martyrs of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
